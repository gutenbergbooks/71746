  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The present volume, the third on “Practical School
Discipline” (the second on “Applied Methods”),
completes the series of books designed for the I. A. D.
Correspondence Course for Teachers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the members of our Teachers’ Club may be
interested to know that a similar course of correspondence
and study has been prepared for parents. Possibly
some of your own “hard cases” can best be
reached indirectly, <i>i. e.</i>, by introducing these volumes
for the parents into the home of the hard case. If you
know a parent who has failed to discipline his child
properly, why not mention the Correspondence Course
for Parents in your next Parents’ meeting! Take along
your teachers’ book to illustrate the sort of practical
treatment the various “cases” receive in the parents’
books. In helping the father or the mother, you are
also helping the child, the school, and yourself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Regarding the present volume our readers will note
that in accordance with the statement contained in
Part I, Part II is a continuation of that book. Partly
to emphasize this fact of continuity, but also to avoid
repetition in the complete index in Part II, the pagination
and the numbering of the cases follow in consecutive
order the two similar series of numbers in Part
II. The division between the two volumes is made
between topics, however, so that except for the very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>close relation between the two books, each of them may
be regarded as complete in itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, permit us to express our hearty appreciation
of the cordial responses which are coming from
the members of the Teachers’ Club, and again to assure
them that their interests are ours.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Adaptation may serve either of two ends. It may fix the
child in a life of indifference, of inefficiency, of crime, or it may
fit him into a world of noble acts and lofty endeavor.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CASES ARISING OUT OF THE ADAPTIVE INSTINCTS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'><i>What are the adaptive instincts?</i> By the adaptive
instincts is meant the power that an individual possesses
of fitting himself, more or less easily, into the
situation in which he finds himself. Such power of
adaptability is of the greatest possible value to the
human infant, coming as he does into an extremely
complex environment, physical and social, and with
the further certainty before him of extremely complex
activities in adult life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fortunately the long period of plastic infancy offers
constant opportunity for readjusting one’s habits,
tastes, accomplishments, etc. Three chief means for
making such readjustments are found in the child’s
tendencies, (1) to imitate, (2) to play, (3) to satisfy
his curiosity.</p>

effective than explanation....”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Betts<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a> defines imitation as “the instinct to respond
to a suggestion from another by repeating his act.”
This is simple and entirely covers the ground. He goes
on to say that the instinct is one of the earliest to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>appear, being very plainly discernible before the normal
child has reached the age of one year. It often
reaches its height by the time the baby is two or three
years old, but is never lost and sometimes persists
strongly into old age. When a child imitates the same
thing several times his imitation becomes a habit, and
so two powerful factors unite to form a customary type
of behavior.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. The Mind and Its Education, 170.</p>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Appealing to the Imitative Instinct</div>

<p class='c007'>One might think that imitation, being strongest in
young children, would appear almost exclusively in
the lower grades of school; but in fact it plays an
important part all the way through the high school.
The things imitated change, but the instinct remains.
In treating cases which are caused or influenced by
this powerful instinct, which the great French sociologist
Tarde considers the greatest factor in human
conduct, there are four methods which can be used:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>1.</dt>
    <dd>The expression of strong disapproval of the acts and their results.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.</dt>
    <dd>Forceful repression—punishment.
    </dd>
    <dt>3.</dt>
    <dd>Changing the nature of the example imitated.
    </dd>
    <dt>4.</dt>
    <dd>The substitution of another and better example for the one imitated.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c007'>The first and second of these four methods are two
degrees and modes of the general means of opposition.
They are sometimes effective, and they are sometimes
necessary and wise. If a very great evil is going on, for
instance, it is fully justifiable to use any means to stop
it, before its harmful effects cause too great suffering
and injustice. If a teacher finds a bully imposing on
a small child, even although he may know that a good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>example to the bully is the means for his ultimate conversion
to kindness and justice, he should stop the bullying
first by the best means at hand, and afterward
set about the character conversion of the bully.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moreover, with very young children, in whom habitforming
is largely a matter of pleasure and pain in
the reactions of their deeds, punishment that is swift,
sure and wise should follow the imitation of a bad
act after its evil nature has been made clear. With
older children, however, who have passed this early
stage, the third and fourth means are usually more
effective. Common sense, supplemented by a fair
knowledge of child nature and the rudiments of
psychology, will dictate where one set of methods ends
and the higher set, which trusts more to the child’s
developing judgment, begins.</p>

<p class='c007'>Imitation begins, as has been said, in infancy. Its
forms will be found to belong to one or another of
the following types:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Types of Imitation</div>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>1.</dt>
    <dd>Imitation of commonly observed acts, such as shaking hands, eating with a spoon, making 
    faces.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.</dt>
    <dd>Imitation of a strong personality, or of strong mannerisms in any personality, which 
    catch attention and command admiration or disapproval.
    </dd>
    <dt>3.</dt>
    <dd>Imitation of an imaged ideal, brought to the imitator through fiction, vivid history 
    instruction, seeing a play, etc.
    </dd>
    <dt>4.</dt>
    <dd>Imitation which is unconscious, usually under stress of high emotion—mob action.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>Of course the most common of these types of imitation
is that of the common customs of the people who
surround the young child. Otherwise it would mean
little to a child to be born into a family in which gentle
manners and kind deeds set a daily example fit to be
followed closely. The manners of most children are
those of their homes; only with a certain degree of
maturity will they see the manners of other homes and
elect to imitate them instead. Next in importance to
this imitation of the social example, is that of some
strong personality.</p>

<p class='c007'>This imitation usually comes through admiration,
although most people will also recall the disgust with
which they have realized that they have unconsciously
imitated some mannerism of an acquaintance, of which
they heartily disapproved. This shows that it is not
necessary to admire an act in order to repeat it. It is
necessary only that the act make a vivid impression
on one, an impression which may be received by some
persons just as readily through strong repugnance as
through strong liking. Twists in pronunciation are
thus imitated in spite of one’s dislike of them, as an
involuntary tribute to the strength of the impression
made upon the hearer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another strong stimulus to imitation is the desire
for the praise of others. John wins father’s enthusiastic
praise for the thorough way in which he cleaned
the motor-car, and his brother Carl cleans it the next
time it is muddy, not because he likes the work but
because he wants to be praised also. Winnie makes
a face at the teacher and wins the praise of her schoolmates
in the shape of an approving laugh, and Jennie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>imitates her at the first opportunity in the hope of
winning a laugh also. That is one reason why successful
people are so much imitated; in addition to
what comes to them through the admiration of the
crowd, there are many who hope to win similar rewards
through similar efforts.</p>

<p class='c007'>And then there are those who imitate others because
they want to surpass them at their own game. This is
emulation, usually classed as a distinct instinct by
psychologists, and yet so closely related to imitation
that the same general principles of treatment apply
to both.</p>

<p class='c007'>Faults which have been learned by imitation can
rarely if ever be cured by didactic instruction. They
have been learned in a far more vivid way, and their
unlearning is best accomplished through the substitution
of other habits, imitated from some attractive and
vivid model. If the process of substitution can be
made a pleasant one, the work goes faster. In general,
the dramatizing of the proposed new order of
things is the surest and quickest way of teaching it,
with children who are young enough for this
method. Merely to condemn old habits, without suggesting
a new and better way, is usually pure waste
of time.</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) <i>Mimicry.</i> “The young child imitates mainly
the simpler bodily attitudes and vocal and facial
expressions of those with whom he is in vital contact.
As he develops he imitates ever more complex activities
of a social, political, ethical, æsthetic and industrial
character. In the beginning it is the doing of an act,

becomes often a source of great annoyance.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 62 (SIXTH GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Mimicry of Speech</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Burch was from Massachusetts, and had an
exquisitely soft voice and unimpeachable pronunciation.
She came to Peoria, Illinois, to teach in the public
schools, and found these two assets very much in the
way. Mabel Gulliver, a little girl whose cleverness was
largely the product of much running of streets, turned
both to account in a series of imitations that “delighted
crowded houses” whenever she chose to hold forth. As
she did this frequently, poor Miss Burch soon found
herself helpless and ridiculous in her own school-room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Authah, will you ausk the janitah to give us a
little moah heat?” Mabel would flute, with inimitable
saccharinity. “And I want you all to cease lawfing at
once, foah this is the clauss in correct pronunciation,
and if youah to be cleavah like me you’ll learn how to
do it properly.” Miss Burch’s manner was the perfection
of simplicity, but in Mabel’s imitation it
appeared with a simpering ingenuousness both funny
and untrue.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Burch realized the situation and wept over it.
She did not know what to do. Realizing she was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>subject of ridicule, she became self-conscious and timid,
and her discipline grew worse and worse.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Things were in this bad shape when Mr. Nearing, the
superintendent, came to visit her one day. He was so
kind and sympathetic that after school Miss Burch
told him the whole story, and asked his advice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The trouble with you is,” he said, “that your most
prominent characteristic is one which lends itself to
ridicule here in the Middle West, where we don’t know
an Italian “a” from a mud-pie. Now, don’t think of
changing your pronunciation; to do so consciously
would be to be affected. But make the children forget
it in something more exciting. If you’d start a museum
for your nature study, or get up a little play for Christmas,
and make Mabel its chief factotum, she’d have an
outlet for her energies, she would still lead her crowd
and have their admiration, and your pronunciation
would fade into the background of the Things That
Are. It’s all a matter of relative emphasis.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Burch did try this plan. She had her room
dramatize and then play The Birds’ Christmas Carol,
and in the intense interest of this project the teacher-mocking
was forgotten. When Mabel remembered it
again, she and Miss Burch were such good friends that
it was out of the question.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>When the imitation takes place in the school-room
the matter is much more under the teacher’s control, for
there is no end of ways in which the child can be kept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>too busy to indulge in histrionic performances. But
whatever is done, the teacher should not appear to
notice that a pupil is disrespectful to her.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (SEVENTH GRADE)</h4>

<p class='c016'>George Henderson was dubbed by his classmates
“the clown” because he was always doing something
laughable. Usually his fun was of a harmless type,
but occasionally his pranks overstepped the bounds of
propriety.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Mimicry of Gesture</div>

<p class='c007'>His teacher, Miss Stanton, had unconsciously fallen
into the habit of making nervous little gestures when
she was explaining lessons to the pupils, and, indeed,
when she was talking with the pupils outside of school.
Several times during recitations she had noticed
George entertaining the pupils near him by imitating,
under the shelter of the desk, of course, all the little
movements of her nervous, energetic hands. She resolved
to overcome the habit of emphasizing her words
by gesture, but the more absorbed she became in her
teaching, the less could she think about her hands. If
she concentrated attention upon her hands, her teaching
suffered and the whole class became listless. Resolved
not to sacrifice the class for the sake of
one fun-loving boy, Miss Stanton next tried another
plan.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mary, you may name all the capitals of the countries
of Europe,” she said.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Mary was about half through with her list of
capitals, Miss Stanton interrupted her with,</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is far enough, Mary; George may finish.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Now George knew the capitals perfectly, but he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>been busy behind the desk with a particularly successful
imitation of Miss Stanton’s movements, and suddenly
surprised, could not recall where Mary had
left off.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Stanton waited just a moment, then said,
gravely, but without any indication of resentment,</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am sorry to have you fail on anything so important
as this, George. Jack may go on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>George sat quite demurely for several minutes, for
he was a little disappointed at losing a chance to recite
a lesson which he had really prepared with considerable
care. However, he comforted himself by thinking:
“Well, she called on me once. She won’t do so again,”
and after a short time he went serenely on with his
dramatics.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Stanton also went on apparently oblivious to
what was taking place behind the desk. After a few
minutes she said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stephen, beginning with the northern countries,
tell us what the farmers raise in each of these
countries.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again she stopped the recital in the midst of it, with</p>

<p class='c007'>“That will do. George, go on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again George lost his chance to recite, not because
he did not know the lesson, but because he had not been
listening to Stephen. In his confusion his face flushed,
especially when Miss Stanton said, in a low tone:</p>

<p class='c007'>“How is this, George? Two failures in one day? I
shall expect a better lesson than this tomorrow. Wilbur,
will you finish the recitation?”</p>

<p class='c007'>George sat quietly for the remainder of the recitation,
thinking to himself:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>“Well, if she has called on me twice, she may get
around again. Gee! I knew all that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Stanton did not call upon him again, however,
that day. On the following day George decided that it
would be well to give enough attention to the recitation,
at least to “keep tab” on what the others were
reciting, and gradually he learned that he was likely
to be called up at any time that he allowed his attention
to wander far away from the work of the hour.
Not a word had been said about his pranks, but they
ceased to be troublesome to teacher or class.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some children are natural actors. They mimic
grown-ups in a ludicrous way. This may be done
unconsciously, but sometimes pupils purposely imitate
a teacher’s walk, attitude, voice or phraseology, just
out of a desire to raise a laugh at the teacher’s expense.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 63 (FOURTH GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Mimicry of Walk</div>

<p class='c007'>George had an unusual gift of ability to mimic
others. Even at the age of nine years he could easily
entertain his classmates by imitating various men of
the town. His teacher, Miss Giles, was a stout little
woman whose arms seemed not to hang closely enough
to her body, and as she walked she swung them as if
they propelled her through the air. Her voice was
fretful whenever she repeated a command, which was
often, or whenever she expected disobedience. One
day as he followed Miss Giles across the room, the
impulse seized him to mimic her gait. This he did,
with marked success. When he returned to his seat
he began to study her mannerisms with a view to entertaining
others. At recess he showed the boys how she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>held her hands and nodded her head while she talked.
The next step was to imitate her voice. This he did
successfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day, about ten minutes before the afternoon
session began, Miss Giles was sitting at her desk, grading
penmanship papers, when Marie Allbaugh rushed
in and said: “Miss Giles, come out here and listen to
George. He’s playin’ like he was you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Giles hardly understood what Marie wished to
tell her, but she followed the child to the front yard
where a crowd of children were around George. Unnoticed
by most of them, she joined in the circle in
time to hear George say in a very good imitation of her
voice, “Children, quietly take your books,” then in
a fretful tone with a frown, “I said <i>quietly</i>.”
“Whoo-ee,” shouted one of the listeners, and all joined
in a laugh when suddenly they noticed Miss Giles
standing there.</p>

<p class='c007'>“George, march right into the house,” said she in her
harshest tones. “You shall not have another recess
until you have apologized to me for this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon the bell sounded for the afternoon session.
When the recess period came, George started to walk
out with the other children.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Giles saw him, and said, “George, take your
seat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After the other children had all left the room, she
went to George’s seat and said, “Are you ready to
apologize?” Just then a shout came through the window
from the children at play. George wanted badly
to join them. He said, “I don’t know how.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say, ‘Miss Giles, I’m sorry I mocked you at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>noon,’” said she. George considered. If he said he
was sorry he would be telling a falsehood. He would
try to be excused without that so he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mother lets me play like I was other people. <i>She</i>
don’t care, so I thought you wouldn’t.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, George, you must always show respect for
your teacher.”</p>

<p class='c007'>George meditated again. The shouts of the children
at play gave him an idea. Wasn’t he sorry he did it?
Wasn’t that just what was keeping him indoors while
others were at play? Of course, he didn’t want to stay
in, so of course he was sorry he had done the thing
that kept him in. With a bright, smiling look at Miss
Giles, he said: “I am sorry, Miss Giles, that I mocked
you at noon.” It looked like a sincere apology and
it passed for such.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may go,” said she. She considered the case
well handled.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Giles would do well to join in the laugh at her
own expense. She should supervise every moment
of the children’s play period. George will not then
have an opportunity to use his imitative powers. He
will be swept into active games and be only one of a
crowd.</p>

<p class='c007'>An apology should not be demanded of a pupil for
any mark of disrespect toward the teacher. Respect
can not be developed by force.</p>

<p class='c007'>If, in spite of these precautions, you sometimes find
yourself the butt of the children’s sport, quietly drop
into the play school, take a seat as one of the play
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>pupils and carry off your part as a naughty child.
“Take off” the troublesome child so well—(not any
particular one, however)—that the children will laugh
with you and the whole thing will pass off as play,
nothing more.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Giles had a rare opportunity of showing her
pupils how to take a joke. She would have gained
friends and lost no more prestige than she did by trying
to force an apology. A wholesome laugh with the
pupils is one of the best things to help overcome disrespect
on the part of the pupils. It would be better,
of course, not to be obliged to laugh at one’s own
expense, too often. Supervised play solves many problems
like this one.</p>

<p class='c007'>An apology unwillingly given is a lie or at best only
a subterfuge. No teacher can command respect by
demanding it in so many words. The teacher can
compel respect only by showing her pupils that she
deserves it.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (RURAL SCHOOL)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Mimicry of Mannerisms</div>

<p class='c007'>It was a rainy day at Mount Pleasant Rural School.
After the noon lunches had been eaten the children
were at a loss to decide what to play. Finally Alice
Mitchell said, “Let’s play school. Who’ll be the
teacher? Who’ll be the teacher?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me!” “Let me!” several of them almost
yelled. Maud Jameson, an overgrown girl, nine years
old, was accustomed to having her way. She was one
of those positive children who win leadership by right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>of having good opinions tersely expressed. Her older
sister even followed her lead.</p>

<p class='c007'>Without more ado, she commanded the children to
take their seats and began a mock school day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Baldwin was at first scarcely interested in the
children. Soon, however, she was struck by Maud’s
imitation of her own expressions. Was it conscious
or unconscious? She could scarcely tell. Would Maud
dare to mock her in her presence? She was not sure
as to that. At any rate she decided to study the situation,
realizing that after this noon time she need not
again say:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O wad some Power the giftie gie us</div>
      <div class='line'>To see oursels as ithers see us.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Maud passed along the seats making faultfinding
comments as she went.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Laura, turn round,” she said, with exactly the
touch of impatience which Miss Baldwin herself would
display.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No indeed!” she answered to one who asked permission
to speak, with exactly the amount of sarcasm
Miss Baldwin herself used on similar occasions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Maud rapped on her desk, and looked around frowning
and shaking her head as a signal to be more quiet—Miss
Baldwin, unmistakably. She tapped the bell
for the children to stand together, and stamped her
foot as she told them to sit because some lagged.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whoever fails to get up this time may stay in at
recess,” she announced, with Miss Baldwin’s own
expression of irritation.</p>

<p class='c007'>For half an hour this went on. Maud scolded and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>sneered, stamped her foot and found fault while Miss
Baldwin listened with varying feelings.</p>

<p class='c007'>At first she decided to stop Maud and punish her.
Yet she considered that her explanation of the reason
for her punishment might be hard to make satisfactory.
Her second thought was to study the situation in
order to ascertain whether the other children considered
it merely a joke on their teacher. They seemed
not to do so. Her next thought was of shame as she
realized the atmosphere created by her attitude toward
the pupils as shown by Maud. She therefore resolved
to let the matter pass without criticism, but meanwhile
to profit by the picture given her of herself as teacher.
This resolve she kept, and as she learned to be patient,
she saw less and less need for impatience.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) <i>Leaving the room.</i> The first grade teacher
should allow her pupils to leave the room whenever
they ask her. In case it becomes an annoyance then
is the time to study the matter carefully and apply
consistent methods. The things to be gained relative
to pupils leaving the school-room, are that they should
leave and enter quietly and as much unnoticed as possible;
that they should not remain absent from the
room too long, and finally, that they do not abuse
the privilege by leaving oftener than necessary. The
teacher must be very judicious in withholding the
privilege of leaving the room. The physical condition
of the child may be such as to require him to
do so often. If anywhere in school management the
teacher needs to practice common sense, it is in
controlling pupils who leave the school-room. Right
habits should be established in the first grade. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>difficult to keep children from abusing the privilege,
and in their anxiety to prevent abuses, teachers often
use methods which arouse the antagonism of the parents.
With the first grade child the best plan is to
have a private talk with the child, explaining the necessity
of going quietly, of going as infrequently as possible,
and of returning as soon as possible. Be careful
to express approval if the child heeds your admonitions
and repeat them when he forgets.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of older pupils, who consciously take
advantage of the extended privilege, we suggest that
you first attempt to gain the confidence of the offending
pupil. To do this, talk to him about his own interests,
show that you are interested in the very same
activities, sports, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is also a good plan to give some definite errand
for the pupil to do for you—something that he can
easily do and will enjoy doing—and after the child
does it, show your appreciation by saying something
like this: “You are so kind. Thank you ever so much.”
This will help you in gaining the pupil’s confidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>After securing this basis of confidence, make it a
point to talk to the pupil individually at some suitable
time. Speak first about something in which the child
is interested, then say, “There is another thing I
wanted to speak to you about. Whenever you go out
at recess, be sure to get your drink and do all other
errands before the bell rings so that you will not need
to leave during study hours unless absolutely necessary.
Try to remember this, will you?”</p>

  <h4 class='c015'>CASE 64 (THIRD GRADE)</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Miss McLean, after a few days of exasperation over
excessive requests for permission to leave the room,
finally decided to correct this. She found in one day
that every pupil left the room at least twice during
the session of school and this was a total of fifty
requests.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Frequent Absences</div>

<p class='c007'>“This will never do!” she said, the next morning.
“You must learn not to interrupt the school work
this way. Now, I want you to see how well you can
keep to your work this morning. We will not give
any permissions to leave the room between now and
recess and between recess and noon time.” In the
afternoon she relaxed somewhat. The next day more
permissions were granted, and finally the situation
became as bad as ever.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>This effort at reform needs system. Adopt the
simple rule that only one person at a time will be given
permission to leave the room. Ask that each request
be presented by first raising the hand. <i>If your pupils
respond readily to your management</i> you may sometimes
trust them to write the name on the board near
the door instead of asking permission vocally. This
plan, however, is more suitable to the high school, and
even then supervision of the privilege must not be
relaxed.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you do have pupils write their names on the blackboard,
upon their return, require them to note after
their names the number of minutes they were absent
and let them make up this “lost time” at intermission.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>In case any pupil insistently leaves the room more
often than you would expect, institute an inquiry as
to his physical health. Ask the family physician or the
mother for this information. In order to cut off the
bad effects of his example before the other pupils, you
can pass the word about, privately, that the doctor
has asked you to give Tom or Mary several interruptions
of study during the day.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>It is easy to catalog the causes that lead to excessive
attempts to leave the classroom, study hall, or grade
room—restlessness, indolence, mischief-making, desire
to play, conspiracy to meet another pupil, carelessness
in habits of nature, physical ill-health.</p>

<p class='c007'>Trouble arises over this matter by careless management
on the part of teachers. Caution is necessary
at two points: (1) Do not allow too many interruptions
of the work; (2) Do not injure the health of
pupils by refusing necessary privileges.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (SIXTH GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Simultaneous Absences</div>

<p class='c007'>In the Normal (Ill.) public schools there were twelve
rooms. Miss Haybarger had the sixth room. Soon
after the opening of school in the fall, a most obnoxious
situation arose because from three to twelve pupils
were released continually. There were enough pupils
out of the rooms to meet on the grounds and indulge
in games. Miss Haybarger decided to save her pupils
from this misdemeanor by insisting that only one pupil
leave the room at a time and that all “time lost”
should be made up. She reported that some days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>passed in which there was not a single request for
permission to leave the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>This result can be further explained by the fact that
every minute of school time was filled with carefully
planned and interesting work. Her general manner
made work and diligence the only possible order of
the day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Epidemics of leaving the room are especially trying
whenever a substitute has charge of a room. If a regular
teacher has good control of his room he should
send a note to the pupils, to be read to them by the
substitute, in which he says something like the following:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am sorry not to be with you today. Be even more
considerate of the substitute teacher than you have
been toward me. I am expecting a fine report from him
as to your behavior today.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This message will do much to stop irregularities.
In case the children are inclined to take advantage of
the regular teacher, the following case will be a helpful
study.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (EIGHTH GRADE)</h4>

<p class='c016'>A teacher who found that one of her brightest boys
was setting a bad example in this respect, dealt with it
in a tactful way which proved entirely successful. She
was an excellent teacher, who trusted her pupils very
fully. They responded to this trust on the whole
admirably, but in one particular case her usual methods
did not work. She said nothing to the boy whose restlessness
was causing the trouble, but assuming that
his frequent absences from the room were caused by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>ill-health, she called on his mother and asked her to
have Robert’s health looked after. The mother
promptly sent Robert to the family physician, who
made a careful examination but found nothing wrong.
All this to-do over his health, together with the trustful
anxiety of his mother and teacher, embarrassed
Robert exceedingly. He finally went to his teacher and
told her that he was “now quite well,” and that she
would not be annoyed any more by his frequently leaving
the room. He was better than his word, for he
stopped leaving the room during the sessions altogether,
and when he stopped the other boys almost
ceased also. Without having said a word to any boy,
without having shown them that she knew they were
indulging in a foolish and childish trick, the teacher
had cured the evil by dealing with the ringleader in a
way that made him ashamed of the quality of his
leadership.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) <i>Coughing epidemics.</i> Often pupils indulge in
epidemics of coughing. One pupil begins, and by suggestion
other pupils join in the annoyance. The usual
method of prevention is a scolding which may arrest
the outbreak but does not remove the tendency to
repeat itself. The very fact that the teacher notices
the coughing intensifies the suggestion.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is to be understood that children often suffer from
colds and must cough. It would be cruelty to attempt
to stop them. A better way would be for the teacher
to ask all the pupils to stand and take several deep
breaths and make some arm movements. The windows
must be opened to admit fresh air for the breathing
and exercises. The teacher can do this without the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>pupils having the slightest idea that it was for the
benefit of the pupil who coughed. In extreme cases of
coughing the teacher can go quietly to the pupil and
ask him to leave the room and take a drink. In most
cases this will stop the coughing. When coughing in
the school-room is unavoidable, every pupil should be
taught how to cough into the handkerchief. The
article serves as a muffler for the sound and as a protection
of one’s neighbors against contagion.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is quite worth while for the teacher to remember
that the more attention she pays to an outbreak of this
kind, the more troublesome it will prove to be, the
oftener it will recur. One teacher who came into a
school in the middle of the term found that the pupils
used coughing outbreaks to annoy and worry their
former teacher. They tried the same on her. But
much to their surprise she went right on with her
work and pretended that nothing unusual was going
on. The youngsters carried their outbreak to the limit
of their capacities, still the teacher went on unheedful
of their efforts at annoying her. When noon came
she dismissed a band of worn-out youngsters. She had
won. They felt themselves outwitted. They did not
try to annoy her again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes a pupil hiccoughs in a way to be annoying.
While at times hiccoughing can not be helped,
still indiscreet teachers have scolded pupils for it and
thereby caused every pupil that could hiccough to do
it in a most annoying manner. Whenever a pupil
hiccoughs, a teacher may quietly ask the pupil to leave
the room or she can have the entire school stand and
take several deep breaths. This will usually cure hiccoughing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>At the same time the windows should be
opened to admit fresh air.</p>

<p class='c007'>(4) <i>Giggling.</i> Some pupils are addicted to “giggling.”
In such cases the teacher will find that to
notice the annoyance will tend to exaggerate it. If she
can ignore it, the possibilities are that the misdemeanor
will cease. However, if it is so marked that it requires
her attention, the method applied must be indirect. It
is quite certain that if a teacher will persist in having
a pupil that “giggles” do something every time he
indulges in the annoyance, he will be cured of his
trivial habit after a month or two.</p>

<p class='c007'>Laughing in a proper way will hurt no one, and is
by no means a misdemeanor. It does children good to
laugh and would sweeten the lives of many soured
teachers if they would laugh more. Often all the pupils
seem to want to laugh. The discreet teacher will let
them have their laugh; he will join with them. When
the fun is over, he will say, “Now let us all get busy.”
If there is a tendency for the laughing to become too
boisterous, he may say pleasantly, “I like to see people
have fun, but if you will remember to laugh quietly
when anything funny happens, I shall appreciate it
very much.”</p>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Giggling at Nothing</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Mayne’s room was as still as a busy school-room
can be, when a little crackling giggle broke the stillness.
Such a noise always stirred Miss Mayne, who
prided herself upon her discipline, as a fly stirs a light
sleeper. It affected her as a personal affront.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Marian, what are you giggling about?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>“Nothing,” says Marian in a stifled voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t tell me that. What were you giggling
about?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know. The other girls were, and I giggled,
too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mattie, were you giggling?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, ma’am, I s’pose I was. But I don’t know
what I was giggling about, either.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, then, I think I’d stop. I can’t see the sense
in laughing about nothing. Let’s have no more of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Silence for a little while. Then a perfect gale of
chirping, gurgling, little-girl laughter—as cheerful a
human sound as exists for the child-lover, perhaps
because of its very meaninglessness, its spontaneity, its
birth in healthy animal spirits. But Miss Mayne must
uphold her reputation as a disciplinarian. And this
time she knows who started the epidemic.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lulu, you began that giggling, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is so funny?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know, Miss Mayne, truly I don’t. I just
have the giggles.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never heard of anything as senseless as this thing
you call ‘the giggles.’ You may come up here and
stand in the corner until you get over ‘the giggles.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>Up to this time Lulu had been simply a lively little
girl with impulses under poor control; but at this punishment
she became a resentful one. At first she was
inclined to turn around and make faces at the other
girls, but, as they were afraid to smile in appreciation,
this grew monotonous, and soon Lulu began to think of
herself as badly abused. She had never been taught at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>home that giggling is a sin; she had an idea that she
was very unjustly treated, and her sense of fairness
was outraged.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next day Lulu, who was a prime favorite and
a leader of the girls, began systematic teasing of Miss
Mayne. She persuaded the other girls to annoy the
teacher with a constant irritating succession of coughs
whenever she started to explain anything. Mattie was
to say that the room was too close, and when the windows
had been opened Muriel was to complain of the
cold, and the rest were to join in a storm of coughing.
This program was carried out, and with great success.
Miss Mayne finally saw that she was being hectored,
and took revenge by standing three girls and one boy,
who had joined in the fun of his own accord, on the
platform. Here they had great fun, standing with
grave faces, pretending to study, until a good chance
came to make a face at Miss Mayne. Lulu capped the
climax by asking Miss Mayne to put a cold compress
upon her throat, as she said this always relieved a cough
for her. She folded a handkerchief and dipped it into
cold water, and Miss Mayne, looking into her upturned
pitiful face, did not know whether to forgive and pity
her or to shake her. She finally decided to shake her,
which made Lulu really sober for once and temporarily
restored the peace.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lulu was a good girl for several days after this, but
when her high spirits demanded another good time in
school, she found similar means of leading the other
girls and boys into mischief. There was an intermittent
feud between her and Miss Mayne, in which the
teacher usually came out second best. Miss Mayne had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>to admit to herself that although her school was sometimes
as good as could be desired, when Lulu wanted
to she could lead the whole room into a maddening
course of annoyance that spoiled the order and spirit
of the day.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Natural leadership, a rare and valuable gift, is usually
combined with unusual ability of some kind or
other, and is always carefully to be reckoned with.
When Miss Mayne found the girl who started the giggling,
she might have said to her:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lulu, have you found out something that is too
funny to keep? No? You are just giggling because
you are giggling? That is too bad; suppose you step
out into the hall until you are over the attack; perhaps
it is too warm for you here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Assume that your pupil knows that people look with
a certain contempt upon causeless giggling, and explain
why. Make clear how important it is for people
to be able to control their facial muscles, their expression,
their laughter; how absolutely necessary it often
becomes to be able to forego laughter. Then suggest
some simple exercises for the gaining of this control;
and above all, show an appreciation of the trouble a
lively little girl has to control her risibilities. Give
her permission, if necessary, to step out of the room
when she feels an uncontrollable desire to giggle; usually
being alone helps to control the spasm. If possible,
interest this leader, with her wealth of spontaneity
and high spirits, in some enterprise in which she
may use all her surplus energy.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>Step out into the hall and ask Lulu solicitously if
she has recovered from her fit of giggling; probably
she will be ready to step to her seat and go on with
her work quietly. If she is not, make her comfortable
in the hall, and tell her to wait after school for a little
talk. You are not punishing her in doing this; you
are trying to cure her of a disease, to help her gain a
control which she has not so far accomplished.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>By treating the meaningless giggling as a disease,
for which kind words and a remedy are appropriate, it
becomes less desirable in the eyes of the girls; it is like
a headache or a cold. With the leader removed and no
irritating opposition on the part of the teacher, the
giggling will soon die down.</p>

<p class='c007'>This attitude is not a pretense on the teacher’s part.
The truth is that spontaneous giggling is sometimes a
sign of serious nervous trouble, and suggests the need
of a specialist’s care. Oftener, however, it is simply
the sign of poor nervous control, and can be overcome
by a little wise and kind guidance.</p>

<p class='c007'>An epidemic of giggling becomes as irresistible to
a group of little girls, and often to big ones as well,
as an epidemic of measles. They do not know how to
control it, and if they think it is going to tease the
teacher, they probably do not want to. The suggestion
of the need of control, the friendly helpfulness in proposing
means of gaining this control, and the readiness
to allow legitimate laughter when it occurs, all remove
the idea of wrongdoing, blame, and antagonism. There
is no longer any fun in giggling to annoy the teacher;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>she is not annoyed, she becomes sympathetic, and the
teaser becomes conscious that something is wrong with
herself.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the laughing first breaks out, however, and
everything seems funny to the pupils for the time
being, then is a good time for the teacher to say something
funny too and thereby associate herself with the
pleasure the children are having. The fact of having
indulged them in their merriment for a moment will
give her greater power to stop them when the laugh is
over.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes, too, an epidemic of laughing comes
merely as a reaction from a long continued period of
study. It should not be treated as an offense in such
a case, but rather as a symptom of fatigue.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (SECOND GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Laughing Permitted</div>

<p class='c007'>Unusual silence reigned in Miss Grey’s room one
Friday afternoon, for she had allowed the children as
a special treat for Friday to have a period of their
favorite pastime, paper-weaving. With absorbed attention
they had worked out their own designs and
little Teddie Hendricks, in his eagerness to show his
teacher what a wonderful figure he had made, could
not persuade himself to wait until she could come to
him; he must go to her. His older sister had carelessly
left her geography on Teddie’s desk and he had been
using it as a sort of framework for his design. A pile
of unused strips of paper lay on one side of the
geography. He picked up the geography upon which
both the paper mat and the strips of paper lay and
started for his teacher. When about half way across
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>the floor a sudden gust of wind from the open window
caught his papers and sent them flying in all directions.
With a puzzled look Teddy stared first at the bare
geography which he held in his hands, then at his
teacher, and then burst out laughing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Teddie, Mr. Wind is having some fun as
well as you, isn’t he?” asked Miss Grey. “Never mind,
we’ll pick them up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the charm which held the room in silence was
broken. One giggle after another was heard from
time to time and presently Miss Grey said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Children, you have worked so beautifully this
afternoon, we’ll all have a little fun together. Teddie
may get the bean bags and we’ll have a little game of
catch. Girls in this row! Boys in that one! Let’s see
how many can catch without once dropping!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ten minutes of substitution of one activity for another
cured the giggles and the rested children went
quietly back to work with no further attacks for the
remainder of the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c007'>(5) <i>Chewing gum.</i> Frequently some teacher is
heard to say that his pupils annoy him by chewing
gum. They even go so far as to chew rubber or even
paper and when told by the teacher to throw away
their gum innocently remark, “I have no gum, it’s
only paper.” Whenever such an annoyance exists it
is largely due to the indiscretion of the teacher. The
trouble with too many teachers is that they denounce
the chewing of gum as an evil, making it out as a sin,
when in truth, it may be beneficial to many and often
such teachers use it themselves when their pupils do
not see them. Is it any wonder pupils worry them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>by chewing gum during school and finish up by sticking
it to the under sides of their desks?</p>

<p class='c007'>How much better it would be for the teacher consistently
to explain to pupils that there really are
benefits to be derived sometimes from chewing gum,
and that when at play or out-of-doors there is no harm
in it, but that in company, in school or in church, it
is not a neat thing to do. Such a teacher has told the
truth and her pupils, large and small, will respect and
appreciate her for it and they will do more; they will
not annoy her by chewing gum during school sessions.
The habit is largely a matter of suggestion and imitation.
One pupil introduces the custom, the others follow
out the suggestion. By relegating the custom to
the school ground, when the pupils are busy with physical
activities of other sorts, the practice will be reduced
to a minimum.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 66 (EIGHTH GRADE)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Smith came from the State Normal School to
have charge of the two upper grades after forming
some very definite ideas on how to maintain order
among adolescent boys.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Gum Chewing</div>

<p class='c007'>The second morning she was conducting an arithmetic
lesson when she found that Susie Hall was enjoying
her chewing gum more than she did the assignment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is your name?” said Miss Smith, pointing
somewhat definitely toward the offending pupil.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am Susie Hall.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Susie, are you interested at all in this work
in arithmetic? I could hardly believe it since I see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>your jaws going” (mocking Susie in a very exaggerated
fashion).</p>

<p class='c007'>Susie was just a little surprised to have her manners
noted so keenly and commented on so quickly, and
replied, “Yes’m. I guess I like arithmetic.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, we can’t have this gum chewing, and you can
just step away from the blackboard and find some place
to throw out your chewing gum. When that is done,
come back and we will see what we can do with this
arithmetic.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Now Susie was only one of a dozen who in former
days had more or less privilege in the matter of gum
chewing, so that there was a sympathetic wave of
resentment quickly resounding throughout the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, there was no immediate outbreak of
anger from Susie or anyone else in the room.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Instead of immediately attempting to suppress the
gum chewing in a child almost totally a stranger, go
across the room, and, after asking Susie’s name, summon
her to you, and very quietly ask her to put away
her gum. After doing that, request Susie to help
you in keeping good order. The chances are that a
girl like her would be more or less bold and dominating
among her associates, so that if a feeling of goodwill
toward her teacher could be developed, it would
be a valuable asset in maintaining the order of the
room subsequently.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Smith transgressed seriously in making so bold
an attack upon the existing situation. She did not yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>know the past habits of her pupils, so that discretion
should have restrained her from being so brusque and
outspoken in her attitude.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Helping to Keep Good Order</div>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Franklin took charge of the Ellsworth grammar
room and found that his predecessor had been extremely
indifferent in the matter of eating sweetmeats
and gum chewing during school hours. This knowledge
came to him by reason of the remains that he
found in the teacher’s desk from the year preceding.
This disclosure led him to expect several of the pupils’
desks to show the same state of affairs; indeed, he
found additional proofs that eating and chewing gum
in the school-room were entirely customary among the
pupils. Subsequently, the first instance which came to
his notice received definite attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ellison Perkins chanced to be the offending pupil.
Mr. Franklin waited until recess, called Ellison to
his desk, and made some inquiry based upon his
suspicions as to the custom of the pupils and teacher
during the past year. Ellison slowly made admissions
that gave the teacher thorough knowledge of the
situation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now,” said Mr. Franklin, “I suppose that you and
the rest of the pupils in our room do not believe that
chewing gum during the school hours is the proper
thing for well-trained pupils.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I suppose not,” said Ellison; “leastwise in
some places they say that we shouldn’t eat in school,
and now and then teacher gave us a mighty talking
to, but he didn’t stop us.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>“Well,” said Mr. Franklin, “we can’t do that way
this year. I want to be sure of what you think is right
about the matter, and if you are willing to help me
keep this room clean, and help the pupils to see what
is right about matters of this sort, I shall be very
much obliged to you. We can’t stand anything that
interrupts our work unnecessarily. Of course, we don’t
intend to work every minute, but if we lose a few minutes
now and then for such things as gum chewing, it
takes too much time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I know,” said Ellison, with more intelligence
than eagerness, since he recalled that during the morning
he had himself revived the old habit; nevertheless,
Mr. Franklin aroused the conviction that he was right.
His appeal to do the right thing was successful and
even though in a somewhat frail fashion, he linked up
Ellison in the plan of reform.</p>

<p class='c007'>(6) <i>Eating in school.</i> Many a first grade child
has been caught by the teacher eating some morsel of
food, a bit of candy, or an apple during school hours.
Such a practice can scarcely be called a misdemeanor.
It is only childish nature manifesting itself. Some
teachers say that no child should be punished or even
reprimanded in the slightest manner for eating something
in school. The first thing a teacher should do
when she discovers a little child trying to satisfy his
hunger, is to give him a knowing smile and a negative
nod of the head. He probably will put the tempting
morsel away. Should he get it again, the teacher can
walk to the offender’s desk and take the food away.
Should this habit become troublesome, the teacher may
require all the pupils to leave their eatables at a certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>place in the school-room. A little tact and patience
will keep in check the tendency to eat things in school.
It is a breach of good manners; it is a childish trait
and should be treated as such. Its chief harm lies in
the fact that if the act is unchecked, other children
through suggestion and imitation will soon be following
the example.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Eating Candy</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Shannon was in the middle of the forenoon’s
work when she noted Alice surreptitiously munching
candy. Her question, “What are you doing?” brought
a useless “Nothing.” Stepping back to Alice’s desk
she found a little girl with mouth crowded full of
candy, hiding additional stores in her ill-concealed
handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where did this come from?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Eliza gave it to me,” was the response.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is it possible! Eliza, have you any more candy?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, ma’am. I have more, but not much. I haven’t
eaten any in school time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I want to see it. My, what a lot! I sometimes
forget and take a bite of something to eat in
school myself. I’ll tell you what let’s do. We all like
candy. Eliza, won’t you pass the candy to all of us?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This won’t give a taste to us all. I’ve got so little,”
was Eliza’s natural response.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, let’s do it anyway. Then we’ll be through
with it quickly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The plan was actually carried out. Pieces were
passed from hand to hand and each child was supposed
to break off a bit and pass on the lump. In about five
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>minutes the eating was over and work was taken up
again.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>There seems to be a breakdown of discipline in this
case where a surrender to appetite is unnecessary. Require
Eliza and Alice to deposit their sweetmeats with
you, on the ground that you will help them to be polite
to other pupils who have no candy. After school is
out in the afternoon, restore to them their property
with a mild caution as to good manners. If the offense
is repeated, keep the candy till the second night. Commend
them for their self-control in waiting.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Shannon exceeded the bounds of propriety in
proposing to eat in school hours contrary to her own
rule. She should by no means confess that she could
not control her own appetite; such admissions induce
children to yield to their own impulses.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Eating Oranges</div>

<p class='c007'>Georgiana Luitivieder’s parents sent her occasional
express packages of fruit from Florida during the
mid-winter months. She was the only child in her
grade whose parents spent the winter south; hence
she could not resist the temptation to take fruit to
school the next day after a case of lovely oranges came
fresh from the trees.</p>

<p class='c007'>A whole dozen was scattered among the members
of her grade. The first signs were the yellow adornments
that bedecked a few desks; one or two fell to
the floor and rolled away. At the same time Abigail
was seen eating an orange on the sly. Miss Galdsworthy
was much annoyed by the troublesome oranges.
Here are her orders:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Abigail, bring your orange and lay it on my desk.”...
“All in this row, who have oranges, bring them
to me.”... “And in this row.”... “The one who
brought these oranges to school may stand.” “Very
well, Georgiana, I want to see you at recess. Now,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>Henry, you may call the janitor for me.” When the
janitor came he received orders to take the oranges
away and not to give them back to the children. He
marched off with a basket full amid groans and protesting
exclamations from all over the room. (After
his departure), “I should think you would know better
than to bring all those oranges into the school-room.
I don’t want this ever to happen again.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Having found out who had distributed the oranges

be in our way if we keep them lying around. You are
going to help me keep order, aren’t you? And I’ll
help you to have a good time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then announce to the school:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ve decided to have our oranges in a delightful

<p class='c016'>Pupils are hopelessly alienated by a procedure that
exceeds the bounds of propriety. Georgiana’s generous
impulses were outraged by loss threatened or actual
of the luscious fruit. A teacher on the ground before
school opened would have found out what was about
to happen, in all likelihood, and could have forestalled
it entirely. But if the teacher directs these generous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>impulses, she will not only avoid school-room disturbances,
but she will be taken yet more intimately into

many of you favor that? Hands up!”</p>

<p class='c007'>All agreed, and each child brought a small contribution
from home. The luncheon was daintily served
in the domestic science room and constituted a fine
safety valve for several strong impulses in the hearts
of thirty-five sixth-grade children.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 69 (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Caramels in School</div>

<p class='c007'>Murry Blane found three young women among his
schoolmates in high school that he felt very warmly
toward. Having an abundance of pocket money, he
spent many dollars first and last in bringing tokens of
his regard to his three friends. For the most part he
managed to do this quietly, so that his devotion was
not subject to discipline, but when Charles Wingate
became principal, things took a slightly different turn.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Wingate knew very well that there were always
pairings off of young folks in high school. He watched
for these groupings of the boys and girls, and when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>he saw Emma Moore laying a row of caramels on her
desk the first question that came to him was, “Who
bought the candy for this girl?” He immediately
went to her desk and quietly asked the question,
“Emma, where did this candy come from?” Such a
question had never been put to her before, although
efforts had been made many times to eliminate lunching
from the high school.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her first answer was, “Why, friends of mine bought
them for me. Isn’t that all right?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course the neighboring pupils heard the answer
and knew what the question was and consequently
their interest was very deeply aroused.</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, yes,” said Mr. Wingate, “it is all right for
your friends to buy you candy, but it is unusual to see
it displayed in this fashion as if it were for sale.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I wouldn’t offer that candy for sale. It is
too precious for that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Following this witty speech, Mr. Wingate saw that
the concern of other students was becoming too intense
and gave up further remarks for the time being,
but an hour later when the matter of having the candy
had apparently been dismissed from his mind, he found
the time to say to the girl, “We don’t want that candy
display to continue, nor do we want any more of it
brought into the assembly room. I want you to tell
me who else shares with you this abominable habit
of bringing stuff to eat to school.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Emma hardly knew what to say, but managed to
frame an answer: “Why, I don’t know who brings
stuff to eat. Everyone brings what he wants, or doesn’t
bring anything, just as he likes.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>“Does Murry bring candy to the girls?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Maybe he does,” said Emma. “Why don’t you
ask him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall ask whom I find necessary to interview, but
I am asking you whether he brought candy and gave
it to you or not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” said Emma, “several of my friends bring
candy, both boys and girls. Perhaps Murry brought
some. I wouldn’t say that he didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Evidently the interview was not going to be satisfactory,
and so Mr. Wingate said, “Well, that will
do for now.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>In high school it is necessary to steer a safe course
between suppression of legitimate pleasures and attacks
on ill-mannered customs made half-heartedly because
of dread of colliding with school sentiment.
Mr. Wingate should not have attempted so broad an
inquiry in so public a manner. It would have been
quite sufficient for the moment if he had said, “Emma,
will you please conceal this candy until later? It is
too attractive to be safe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>If there were no grievous interruptions of school
work, decisive action should have been deferred until
profitable conversations had given Mr. Wingate an
opportunity of developing definitely some sentiment
upon the obnoxious habit. This could be begun the
very same day on which he encountered the row of
candy on Emma’s desk, but owing to the desire of
high school girls very generally to make a good appearance
in public, Mr. Wingate might readily attempt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>to cure the ills of his own school by a series of definite
lessons on good manners.</p>

<p class='c007'>Link this up with instruction in domestic science,
so as to give it due emphasis and dignity. Make
it evident that eating is to take place only at the table
or under circumstances where the entire group enters
without embarrassment into the pleasure of the
occasion.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Wingate ventured on uncertain ground. He
was in a minority when attacking the custom in so
public a manner. He pulled on a projecting beam and
loosened the whole framework of a social custom
without knowing what his next move would be if
things came tumbling down.</p>

<p class='c007'>What was needed was a larger program of action.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plan of working out the dilemma from the standpoint
of domestic science gives permanence and dignity
to the reforms proposed. A disciplinarian must
never intimate that his requirements are trivial or
personal or disconnected with the general good of
the school. As soon as one or a hundred pupils can
feel that they are out of class by holding to an old
custom the reforms proposed will make rapid headway.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Marshmallows</div>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Pendleton was principal of the high school at
Downs, Ohio.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having been fully forewarned by past experience
that high school pupils easily fall into the eating habit
in school, he had provided a place in his course in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>domestic science for instruction on manners on the
street and in public places with regard to eating.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, in the first place, he discussed the matter briefly
with his teachers and found that there was a satisfactory
state of opinions there on this as well as on a dozen
or twenty other small points which he decided to deal
with early in the school year.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Davis, instructor in domestic science, agreed
to make this a preponderant point in her instruction.
Even in class she strictly prohibited and prevented
“lunching and munching,” insisting that those who
received instruction must eat at the table and observe
all the rules of good conduct.</p>

<p class='c007'>With this example and instruction as a recognized
fact, the girls of the high school were ready to yield
very graciously to Mr. Pendleton’s request that no
one bring articles of food to the high school. This
request was made, by the way, only after Eloise
Thomas, member of the first-year class, had walked
into the room one morning with a generous sack of
marshmallows in her hand. He made no allusion to
her individually, but spoke as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have been very much pleased so far this year to
see that the usual customs of public assemblies have
been observed on nearly every point. Sooner or later
it may be that someone may be attempting to distribute
sweetmeats among his friends and so occasion an interruption
in our regular work. Of course such a
thing could hardly be tolerated in a company of well-bred
people. The standards that have been set in our
domestic science department are entirely in accord with
requirements of good society, so that I trust that every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>member of the school will be governed by them and
cheerfully assist in maintaining the good conduct that
has so far been observed during the school year.”</p>

<p class='c007'>(7) <i>Smoking on the school grounds.</i> Sometimes it
is impracticable to change the example except by
changing the giver of the example. If a fine boy or
girl can be made the leader where a weak or vicious
one has been leader, wonderful changes may take
place. Such a change was effected in the following
instance.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 70 (SEVENTH GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Cigarettes</div>

<p class='c007'>The practice school of Bodeling College was so good
that large numbers of boys and girls came out by
streetcar from the neighboring large city to attend it.
These boys and girls took the cars at a convenient station
near the campus, where an enterprising business
man had built a Station Store, which furnished textbooks,
stationery and refreshments, and gave shelter
in bad weather. This store was a great convenience,
but the college authorities found it also much of a
nuisance, for here a group of “smart” high school
and town boys gathered, to loaf and smoke and set a
bad example to the smaller boys in many ways.</p>

<p class='c007'>The grammar grade teachers found the cigarette evil
especially hard to deal with. The seventh and eighth
grade boys, seeing their elders swaggering about with
cigarettes, imitated them freely. There were a number
of fine high school boys who did not smoke, but they
rarely went home as soon as the smokers, and so the
smaller boys saw most of the smoking set.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Steele, the seventh grade teacher, went to Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>Hardy of the eighth and they had a conference. At
its close, Miss Steele announced her program:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m going to appeal to plain reason; I shall show
them so clearly that they can’t fail to understand how
cigarettes hurt them in every way, and then appeal to
their sense of loyalty to themselves and their future.
When they know how cigarettes rob them of health and
ability, their good sense will dictate to them what
to do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Steele planned her campaign well. She was a
large, plain, wholesome-looking woman, a good thinker
and a notable figure in all movements for public welfare
in her community. Her pupils all respected her,
and her school-room management was above criticism.
She planned and delivered now a series of talks on
cigarettes, in which she explained clearly just why they
are so especially harmful to the young and what a
losing game the cigarette-smoker plays. Her pupils all
listened closely, the smokers with the rest.</p>

<p class='c007'>When she had exhausted the subject, she asked all
those who were resolved never to smoke cigarettes to
raise their hands; for she had had successful experience
with the effectiveness of a public pledge. Every pupil
in the room but one raised his hand. This one pupil
was the son of a prominent attorney, a smoker and a
leader among the boys. His father had instilled in him
so keen a sense of honor that, because he did not intend
to stop, he refused to make the promise.</p>

<p class='c007'>But in spite of this well planned campaign the smoking
in the seventh grade continued. Some of the boys,
with the low ideals of honor which characterize youthful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>cigarette users, had had no intentions of stopping;
others were sincere in their intentions, but yielded to
example or habit when the effects of Miss Steele’s
warning grew cold. As the stories of the failure of
her efforts came to the teacher, she became more than
ever convinced that the use of cigarettes causes unspeakable
moral degradation. It did not occur to her
that her method of attacking the evil could have been
a mistaken one.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>To combat successfully the smoking habit in the seventh
and eighth grade boys, it is necessary to substitute
for the sensory pleasure of smoking an equally intense
or more intense stimulation of another sort.</p>

<p class='c007'>Show the pupils that indulgence in habits of this
sort will certainly rob them of keener delights of a
more innocent type.</p>

<p class='c007'>See to it that the innocent pleasures are <i>within reach</i>—not
far distant and hazy in outline.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Steele failed by placing before her class a motive
so remote in time that it could not be very intense
as a stimulus to self-denial. Thirteen-year-old boys
have not done a vast amount of thinking about the
possibilities of the distant future. For them the present
and the immediate future are the all-absorbing
topics.</p>

<p class='c007'>How could the three desirable conditions—nearness
in time, innocent enjoyment, and intensity of stimulation—be
combined so as to supplant the undesirable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>conditions which had led to the smoking habit? This
was the problem over which Miss Hardy was pondering.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (EIGHTH GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Athletics versus Smoking</div>

<p class='c007'>Meantime Miss Hardy had been studying her psychology,
and between times had been talking athletics
with her old pupils who had passed on into the high
school. The high school teams were well coached and
in football had made a good record that gave promise
of being equaled in basket ball. The best man on the
teams was Raymond Johnston, who was one of those
marvels of all-around excellence who happen once in a
while to rejoice the hearts of teachers. He was a big,
handsome boy, with a bluff charm of manner which
won all hearts, and ready friendliness which made him
the idol of the school. He was a star student, who
had made a good record in debating as well as in
athletics.</p>

<p class='c007'>Raymond Johnston belonged, moreover, to a prominent
family in the nearby city, a family in which high
ideals of manners and morals were so intrinsic a part
of living that the children grew up healthy, unconscious
exponents of all that is best in character and
living. It was this fine, talented boy whom Miss Hardy
chose to do for her boys what she knew, able as she
was, she could not herself do effectively.</p>

<p class='c007'>At first Raymond Johnston declined with embarrassed
modesty to give a series of talks on athletics to
the eighth grade pupils. But when Miss Hardy had
explained to him clearly the great need, and had shown
him that he alone could do the thing that must be done,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>he finally consented. The two planned a campaign as
carefully as Miss Steele had done; and when the plans
were complete, Miss Hardy told her pupils of the treat
she had secured for them.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the first three talks there was no mention of
cigarettes at all. The speaker gave a lively account of
the four great ball games, with blackboard diagrams
of positions and plays, and anecdotes from his own
experience which added the personal touch needed.
For a boy he was a ready speaker, and his enthusiasm
knew no bounds. When he had given the three talks,
Miss Hardy saw with satisfaction that the first step
was gained; her boys and girls understood the games
very well, and discussed them with the air of conscious
experts. All day they talked of nothing but forward
passes, and overhand serves, and left-twist curves, and
the latest “dope” on basket ball prospects. This was
in the winter term, when basket ball held the front of
the stage. She knew they must be talking athletics at
home, awake and asleep; she knew that, vivified by his
virile example, Raymond Johnston had won that room
to the athletic ideal of manhood in a healthy and
natural way, and that with an ideal of conduct-controlling
vividness gained, the rest of the campaign
could be carried out with good hopes of success.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Raymond gave his fourth talk on “The Making
of an Athlete.” He talked about fresh air, food, sleep,
clothing, training and regularity of habits. He
touched on the ethics of sportsmanship, and every boy
in the room resolved to be “square” and conceived a
vast contempt for the “yellow streak” that the high
school hero treated with such scorn. Then Raymond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>took up the cigarette question, as the next step in his
outline of the athlete-making process.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course a man can’t smoke if he wants to make
the team,” he said. “Some of the high school fellows
do smoke, but they aren’t the ones who make good
at athletics or anything else. You’ll see them hanging
around the Station Store afternoons, when the fellows
that make the team are out training. Why don’t you
eighth graders come out and watch us sometimes, by
the way, instead of going right home after school?
You’d get lots of pointers that would help you. You
have your own teams, don’t you? If not, why not
organize some? You ought to have three or four in
this grade, for you’ll be in the high school next year
and you ought to be in training.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But remember, you can’t eat piles of doughnuts
and you can’t smoke if you ever want to do anything
in athletics. Rich food puts your digestion out of
commission, and smoking goes straight to your heart—and
that’s what you can’t stand when you’re playing.
They make you fall behind in your lessons, too,
and then you’re not allowed to play on a team. I
never smoke, and the other fellows that do anything in
athletics or debating don’t either. We can’t; we know
better.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, I hope this spring you fellows will all get out
and get some good training in baseball and track, because
when we’re gone we want to hear that the high
school is keeping up her old record; and it’ll depend
on you fellows that are coming on. You can do as well
as we have or better, if you just will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Hardy’s plan did work. It worked because she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>substituted a good ideal for imitation instead of a poor
one. The poor one had been presented to her boys without
her consent; she had to make an intelligent effort to
get the fine one vividly before them. She did not
arouse opposition by making her cause too obvious, by
forcing the didactic tone; it appeared as one part of
an attractive program—but it was made clear that it
was an indispensable part. She followed up the talks
with suggestions that fostered the organization of baseball
teams in the spring, the regular coach coöperating
with suggestions and occasional instruction. Her boys
seemed to have forgotten that they ever thought it
smart to smoke. When she left at the end of the year,
the coach told her that he was certain that not one of
her boys was a user of cigarettes.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION 2</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Remove Temptation</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Hardy was succeeded the next year by a young
man fresh from the training department of a great
university, who was enthusiastic and keenly analytical.
The non-smoking eighth grade boys had now gone
into the high school, and he was met by the same problem
that had defeated Miss Steele. He realized that
while Miss Hardy’s plan had worked with her boys,
still the evil existed in the community as a constant
menace, and he resolved to reach the root of the trouble
if possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>There seemed to be several roots: the smokers in the
high school, the Station Store where the boys loafed,
the indifferent parents, the shops where the boys were
sold, contrary to law, the materials for their cigarettes.
The story of how these elements in the problems were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>reached is too long to recount here; but it was done
by arousing the interest of the parents, who were
stirred into action by a rather lurid talk given by the
new eighth grade teacher, and who organized for the
definite purpose of removing the temptations to smoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>The efforts of Miss Hardy and Mr. Sulzer, the
eighth grade teachers, were successful because they
attacked the force which set the example. Imitation
grows into habit rapidly, and when both imitation and
habit are allowed to become cumulative, it takes more
than a logical protest to change conduct. In one case,
the bad example was displaced by one which was made
more attractive than the old model; in the other, public
conscience was aroused and used as an agency for the
elimination of the bad example. The worst kind of a
bad example is that of older people who connive at
an evil.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION 3 (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<p class='c016'>The following letter from a correspondent of the
I. A. D. Teachers’ Club also has a bearing upon the
control of smoking on the school grounds:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Boy Is Caught Smoking</div>

<p class='c007'>I was principal and high school teacher in a little
school down South. One of my most interesting pupils
was also the most difficult to manage—Herbert, a bashful,
overgrown, intelligent, fourteen-year-old, the ringleader
in all mischief and the idol of the playground.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the grade teachers caught one of her boys
smoking cigarettes one day. Upon investigation three
other culprits were discovered among her charges, but
it seemed that Herbert was also guilty. The nature
of the case and the custom in that state demanded that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>the younger boys be whipped, but I knew that Herbert
was more truly responsible and my heart was heavy,
for I had worked hard to gain his confidence and I
was fond of the boy. A mistake on my part would
make him sullen and unmanageable and the smoking
would then go on in spite of me.</p>

<p class='c007'>After school was out, I dispatched the younger boys
as quickly as possible, asking Herbert to wait in another
room for me. He was very sober when I came
in and I was wondering how to begin the difficult task
ahead of me, when a glance from him gave me a clue.
It was defiant, appealing and apologetic, all at the
same time. The boy and I had been somewhat like
chums up to this time.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Herbert, tell me all about it, won’t you?” I began.
“I want to hear just how it happened and how much
smoking there has been.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There hasn’t been very much,” he said, with his
eyes down. “We’ve smoked dry leaves and corn
shucks, but we’ve only smoked real tobacco twice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was on the defensive at once, I saw, but his confidence
was in a measure restored by my opening—giving
him a chance to tell his side of it. I drew him
out, not condemning him, but merely looking very
grave, until I had a full account of just when and
where the smoking had occurred. I did not insult him
by doubting him and he gradually lost his defiant attitude
and grew more and more shame-faced.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Herbert,” I said, when the recital had come to an
end, “what would your father say?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He would lick me until I couldn’t stand up.”
This was literally true, for the boy’s father was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>hard drinker and subject to violent fits of anger when
his children displeased him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall not tell him, this time. But if it happens
again, I think he should know about it,” I said. “Herbert,
you know you can do what you please with these
grade boys here in this school. They look up to you
and follow your leadership. You can make them do
what is right or you can lead them astray.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He shook his head violently at this, but was too near
to tears to speak.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We may think we aren’t our brothers’ keepers,
Herbert, but we are, just as the Bible tells us. It is
really you who are responsible for this affair, because
you are older and know better than the others the evils
that come from the use of tobacco.” And I talked to
him a little about the effects of tobacco upon growing
boys. I thought he seemed impressed and penitent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m going to put you in charge of the whole matter.
I want you to see to it that there is no more smoking
after this. You can report to me once a week what
sort of success you have, but we won’t say anything
to the others about the arrangement.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He protested that he couldn’t do it, but finally
blurted out “I’ll try,” and I shook hands with him on
the agreement.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reports proved the success of my scheme and
I found I had made a warm friend and ally of Herbert.</p>

<p class='c007'>(8) <i>Manners, good and bad.</i> Nowhere, perhaps, is
the influence of the imitative instinct more potent than
in the shaping of one’s manners. “<i>Manners make the
man</i>,” is a legend inscribed over the door of one of
the buildings of Oxford University, and in order that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>the pupils shall go out from its doors possessed of
the high claims to the respect of their fellow men
which good manners affords, exquisite care is taken
that those adults who are daily associated with the
pupils are themselves possessed of such manners as
are worthy of imitation. All unconsciously to themselves,
these manners will soon be reproduced in the
pupils with more or less exactness.</p>

<p class='c007'>But if good manners are assimilated through association
with those who possess them, bad manners are
no less surely learned in the same way. The teacher
who is confronted then with a room full of rude, noisy,
untidy children, should never regard these bad manners
as a personal affront to himself, but rather as a
result of social “copy” unconsciously imitated by his
pupils and requiring time and patience and a substitution
of “copy” of the opposite sort before such
manners can be eradicated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Social Imitation</div>

<p class='c007'>Persons outside of the school quite often show a
lack of respect for those whom they meet on the public
highways or on the streets. This lack of proper training
is not very different from that of pupils who constantly
disregard the rights of other pupils or who
persist in mistreating other pupils whenever they can
get a chance. Those pupils who persistently do these
things are simply following “social copy.” The motive
underlying each of these misdemeanors is the
same, namely, selfishness, which is the basis of impoliteness.
No polite child will jeer at strangers or
even acquaintances or schoolmates, nor will he disregard
the rights of schoolmates, expecting more for
himself than for those with whom he associates. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>will not mistreat his playmates “just for fun” or for
the pleasure of tantalizing them. Much of such lack
of kindness and politeness is due to neglect on the part
of parents. Many parents never take the time to teach
their children to be kind and thoughtful of others.
When such pupils enter the first grade, their conduct
can be changed greatly by the teacher who will make
the effort.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is presupposed that the teacher will himself practice
every trait of politeness and kindness. He will
not be guilty of any of the above misdemeanors. That
means much to the pupil who disregards the rights of
his associates. Still the teacher’s conduct along these
lines will not wholly prevent a pupil from practicing
one or all of these misdemeanors. Close supervision
of all the school-room and playground activities will
do much to prevent rudeness, but will not entirely
abolish it. Naturally parents and patrons expect the
teacher to be the mediator for better conduct on the
part of some pupils.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps suggestive control will effect prevention
in the first grade better than any other method. Just
before school is dismissed the teacher may tell a story
to all the pupils, the point of which is to teach kindness
towards others. She may then suggest how fine it
would be for all of the pupils to go home on this particular
evening and be courteous to every one whom
they meet. She can suggest the little courtesies of
saying “Good evening,” etc. Her entire talk must
be permeated by a spirit of kindness and she must
expect that her pupils will do nothing less than she
has told them. The chances are that they will obey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>her for the first evening, but on the second evening
they will forget. In a few days she may need to repeat
the talk. Each time she makes the suggestion she
should follow it up by approving the children for good
conduct while going home.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the teacher wishes to deal with a pupil individually
she can apply the same methods as for the pupil
that quarrels or fights. (See treatment of quarreling
and fighting.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Often school children show impoliteness in a marked
degree. It may be a result either of poor home training
or because of the teacher’s bad manners. The
teacher who is impolite can not expect her pupils to be
polite.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some teacher may ask, “Just what constitutes impoliteness
on the part of the teacher?”</p>

<p class='c007'>That teacher is impolite who meets her pupils outside
of the school-room and does not speak to them;
who does not beg pardon when she accidently bumps
against a pupil; who does not say, “Thank you,” when
a pupil bestows a favor; who does not greet her pupils
with a cheery “Good morning” or a pleasant “Good
night”; who is rude and rough; who speaks in a high-pitched
tone of voice instead of a sweet, low, pleasing
tone; who says gruffly, “What?” when she should
say, “Repeat it again, please,” and who keeps her
desk in disorder. There are other traits of impoliteness,
but the above will enlighten the teacher who
fails to know the marks of ill-breeding.</p>

<p class='c007'>To prevent impoliteness on the part of pupils, the
teacher needs but to practice the opposite of the above.
She may give a few talks on politeness, but the best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>way to teach that subject is to be polite. The little
ones are imitators. They like formal politeness and
will imitate the teacher. Extremes of formality must
be avoided. Overdoing the matter has a tendency to
repel pupils.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every trait of politeness can easily be taught if the
teacher will watch for its occurrence, and then casually
remark how she admires that particular characteristic
in her pupils. A certain little boy tipped his
hat to an elderly lady as she passed the school. The
teacher saw it. When school convened she said, “I am
proud of my pupils because I saw one lift his hat to a
lady today.” She said no more, but every boy aspired
thereafter to recognize women by lifting the hat. On
another occasion a little girl picked up her glove. Her
recognition of the act was, “Thank you, my dear.”
Others heard it. Afterwards they sought to do the
teacher favors. Again, she stood by the window when
a farmer passed the schoolhouse with a large wagon.
The wind blew off his hat. A little boy ran and
picked up the hat and returned it to the farmer. When
the bell rang and all were in their seats, the teacher
told the pupils how proud she was of them because
they were polite. She avoided singling the boy out.
That would have caused envy in some of the pupils,
but to be proud of all, made all feel that the act was
a possession of the entire school and that which one
boy could do, could be done by any pupil.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 71 (SECOND GRADE)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Wallis, teacher of the primary at the Wendell
Phillips School, was picking her way carefully through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>the crowd one Monday, when her eye fell on Walter,
one of her own pupils. He, too, was moving as fast as
possible and just before attempting to cross Thirty-ninth
street he overtook a lame man. The crutches
sprawled out somewhat helplessly and annoyed many
of the passers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Street Manners</div>

<p class='c007'>Walter halted scarcely a second, but as he dived
past the unfortunate man, he brushed hard against
another pedestrian and fell toward the man with the
crutches. All in a second the one crutch was knocked
out of his hand and down he fell with a heavy thud
to the walk.</p>

<p class='c007'>Walter did not look back until he was across the
street and then he saw no sign of the lame man.</p>

<p class='c007'>At school Miss Wallis took a firm hand in the matter,
by having Walter stand before the pupils of his room,
tell his story, and let Miss Wallis rush past him and
knock him down. The fall, plus the injury to his
feelings, made him take a good cry on the spot. His
teacher concluded the incident by saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, I guess you will not do that again soon, will
you?”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Instead of the negative instruction, <i>i. e.</i>, telling what
not to do, teach a positive lesson; let one pupil impersonate
a lame man; have several pupils or all of them
rushing past him; let some one or two offer to pilot
him across the “street,” which may be marked off on
the floor. In discussing the matter, if discussion seems
needful, assume that all of the pupils really want to be
courteous and kind but forget it in their haste.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The attempt to impress the lesson, by dramatic exhibition,
may easily fail because the wrong theme is
presented or the realistic feature is carried too far.
Particularly when working with young children, the
negative types of action should not be dwelt upon if it
is avoidable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Acquirement of polite manners can be attained only
by gradual steps. Assisting a lame man on the street
is a matter that every child in school can comprehend.
For young children the lessons in politeness should
bear on the obvious and most necessary points of contact
between persons. Although many impulses to
courteous treatment arise in a child, there is always
need to teach him how to perform the acts which convention
has fixed upon as necessary to good breeding.
The greatest advances will be made by helping the
child to take the other person’s point of view. This
will be certain to elicit sympathetic responses.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Dramatizing Effectively</div>

<p class='c007'>At school came her first serious lessons in courtesy.
Miss Johnson, the primary teacher, had her whole
room organized as a family, father and mother, aunts
and uncles and children. It was a birthday celebration
for grandmother, there were songs, a “piece” to
speak and a “dinner” to be eaten. Only thirty minutes
were devoted to the whole thing, and no extra
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>school time preparation was needed. The “dinner”
was made up of dishes produced by the imagination.
The necessary instructions as to good behavior were
given as needed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The event passed off with great satisfaction to pupils
and teacher. All that was needed for Verna was special
supervision and commendation, as she was given
the place of mother, which she represented with hearty
eagerness.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Picnic Manners</div>

<p class='c007'>North Lord School celebrated the coming of summer
with a picnic. Miss Bradford attended carefully
to everything except the behavior of her pupils.
Scarcely had the crowd gathered, before she began
directing the boys and girls how to conduct themselves.
Calling out from a distance, she said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shame on you boys for taking the swings first.
Let the girls have a good time, then you can have the
swings if you want them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Several older girls made a dash for the bridge that
led over to the other side of the railroad tracks. They
were out of sight in a moment with the teacher on a
hot chase. When she overtook them there was another
scolding.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re a pretty lot! There’ll be several girls
sent home now if there is any more running off like
this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On returning to the group of children she heard a
confusion about the lunches:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here, let me. I’m going to get out the lunches.”
“No, get out, you can’t manage this.” Meanwhile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>some one was ordering them all away from the lunch
baskets.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus it continued to the end with noisy, and in
large part, fruitless attempts on the part of Miss Bradford
to keep some sort of order and decorum.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Arrange for details of conduct before the event
comes off on occasions like this. As a basis for good
order, organize the school into committees, assigning
specific duties to each and develop a sense of dignity
in each pupil, sufficient to sustain the part appointed
to him. Give explicit instructions on certain urgent
matters.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If the girls gather around the swings, offer them
an opportunity to use them; the chairman of the swing
committee will see that this regulation is carried
out.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Paul will attend to the lunches. Any one may
place a lunch in his care at any time, and receive a
check for it. But no one can get his lunch out until
11:45. Paul will attend to this without fail.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Do not attempt too many regulations; be content
with a few clearly stated, necessary directions.</p>

<p class='c007'>This method with slight modifications should be followed
with children of all grades.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>System and reasonably good manners have an appeal
for children because of the desire they have to imitate
adults. Appointment to office gives a child authority
and evokes a corresponding respect from other children.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>If each child is given a task, he quickly senses
the situation when required to conform to the standards
of courtesy which he wants others to follow in
dealing with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is always needful to plant at once, perhaps many
times, seeds of new acts, sometime before the fruitage
is expected. A little reflection will often permit a
child to adjust himself, when, if required to act instantly,
he would break out in rebellion.</p>

<p class='c016'>Superintendent Blair yielded to an urgent demand

<div class='sidenote'>Handling a Crowd</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss McAuley, in charge of the sixth grade, was
appointed custodian of the water supply and as head
usher, with instructions to drill the boys and girls in
her room to do the necessary work. She gave instructions
and practiced her pupils on these two matters.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The ushers will say, ‘Dinner is now served, come
this way, please.’ ‘Men’s hats may be left here.’—‘May
I show you to the drinking fountain?’—‘This
way out, please.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>At first the novelty of the situation created more
or less of a titter, but in a few days the pupils mastered
the set phrases and practiced on their own number
with a real enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every other room in the school had a small part in
bringing the event off in a satisfactory manner. Of
course the general conduct of the school was thoroughly

<div class='sidenote'>Rudeness</div>

<p class='c007'>“John Mason! I saw you! You go to the office at
once!” Miss Maile spoke partly as a form of apology
to a gentleman who was brushing the dust from an
expensive hat. The embarrassed teacher continued:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am very sorry that John treated you so rudely.
I saw him rush by you, glance at your hat as it rolled
away and dash on to where I stood. He’ll catch it
from the principal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ere long the principal began his interview. He
spoke with voice of thunder: “Well, what are you in
here for? I saw you here last week, didn’t I? Come,
now, tell me your story.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I knocked a man’s hat down.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I know you knocked a man’s hat down. But
tell me about it. What did you do it for?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was sailing in the east door and struck his hat—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, just tell me why you knocked his hat down
and why you went on without picking it up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I just hurried and didn’t see—” John felt very
little like doing anything more about excusing himself,
he could not tell why.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may go. If I catch you again acting like that
I’ll tan you right.” The boy was dismissed with a
shove that showed but the faintest trace of friendliness.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Maile can easily keep this matter out of the
superintendent’s hands by inviting the gentleman into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>her room, appointing a committee to apologize for the
room, since one of its members has committed a breach
of good manners. The words can be very few.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are sorry to have been rude. Please excuse
us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We would suggest also in a school where there is
a strong tendency toward bad manners, that you
apply the principles of suggestion and approval.
Some morning when the pupils are in a good mood,
say:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I want to tell you how <i>proud</i> I am this morning.”
(Smile at this point, allowing your pupils to wonder
what you are going to say next.) Then, after waiting
four or five seconds, continue: “I have been watching
pupils in my classes lately, both here in the school and
outside, and I have noticed many pupils who are very
polite. It looks fine to see a pupil pick up something
another has dropped. I remember a boy—a fine looking
fellow—everyone liked him, and I used to wonder
why it was that everybody spoke to him and why
everybody liked him so well. I noticed that whenever
he saw a chance to do a kind act for anybody he always
did it. If he happened to annoy anybody, he always
stopped and told the person he was sorry; whenever
he walked in front of anybody he always said, ‘Excuse
me,’ and he always made everyone feel happy because
he was so kind. That is the kind of a person <i>I</i> like,
and I believe that is the reason he was liked so well.
I visited a school once in which all the pupils were just
as polite as could be, and the teacher seemed to be
proud because the pupils showed such good manners.
I tell you, I am going to watch from now on to see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>how many boys and girls in my room are polite. It is
certainly fine to do a kindness for someone. I like the
boy or girl who does it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The next day, smile again and say, “I’m even
prouder than I was yesterday morning. I saw several
kind acts yesterday by my pupils. I tell you, I appreciate
it very much.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>If acts of courtesy can be made a social affair, a
powerful impetus will be exerted toward reform. So
long as a boy thinks he acts exceptionally well if he is
polite, and so stands in a class by himself, he will give
only grudging attention to matters of etiquette. Just
as largely as possible we should use the group to teach
the individual.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case cited, the superintendent and teacher
taught more ill-manners by their example than they did
good manners by precept. They were brusque, rude,
unsympathetic, tactless, and ineffective.</p>

<p class='c007'>Strict conformity to rule can be as clearly required
and uniformly enforced by methods that are not dictatorial
and terrorizing. The latter may secure a few
immediate formal results; the more cultured methods
will draw out a pupil’s interest and hearty response.</p>

<p class='c007'>Robert and Josiah Nash are thirteen-year-old twins.
Their present sport is kite flying. Yesterday they were
intently gazing skyward and backed up into Mrs. Scudder’s
star flower-bed on the north side of her house.
The quickest way out was to continue their backward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>course. They left a path of destruction as they
emerged on the opposite side.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Scudder saw them as they left the premises,
and was thoroughly angered with them as she rushed to
view the remains of her precious flowers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The boys were too much concerned with their fun
to attend to the damage they had done, but just before
supper time, the two appeared at Mrs. Scudder’s front
door. Her face fell into a troubled appearance at once,
but the boys got in the first words:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We came to settle for the damage we did this
afternoon,” was their first sentence. “How much do
we owe you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, would you think it damage! I should say
there is damage! I saw you boys go on and I thought
that was the last I’d see of you. Come out here and
I’ll show you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>All of their courage fled for a moment at these words.
But they obediently followed her, not knowing what
next to expect. The three stood about the beautiful
flower-bed, as Mrs. Scudder resumed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now you boys have done the manly thing and I am
going to meet you more than half way. Let us all
quickly straighten up these poor trampled things and
water them. If you’ll help me do that, I shall thank
you very much, and we’ll consider everything square.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The task was soon accomplished. On the way home
the boys vowed that they did not wish to be so careless
again since Mrs. Scudder had, after all, shown such
a good spirit toward them.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a system of schools organized with any approach
to thoroughness the most serious problems of politeness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>have been solved long before the grades are completed.
Repeated associations and the formation of friendships
with persons of dignity, refinement and culture, no
doubt will necessitate more adjustments as time goes
by. How to acquire the manners of a new environment,
and the necessity for so doing are fully worked
out in the grades. But too often, something remains
for the high school to do in the direction of training
in good manners.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 74 (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Reforming Manners</div>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Robertson found enough trouble on his hands
when he took the Allentown High School without giving
any special attention to such matters as politeness
and good manners, generally.</p>

<p class='c007'>His first assistant, Miss Sibley, finally overcome with
disgust, fairly demanded of him that he do something
to improve conditions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These people are perfect boors. They have no more
caution about the commonest courtesies than street
Arabs.” In fact many of them did roam the streets
with no home restraint.</p>

<p class='c007'>Aroused from apathy, Mr. Robertson set his machinery
into action. The next morning he gave a long
talk in the assembly period, mentioning about twenty
forms of courtesy which he insisted they must adopt.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must be careful to tip your hats, boys, when
you meet ladies. Don’t talk loud on the street. Don’t
shove people about when you hasten through a door,”
etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several whispered remarks showed how the talk was
taken.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>“What’s this he’s stuffing down us?” “Something’s
come over him. He’ll get better!” “We can’t
take on all that gaff.” “I get all of that at home that
I want; shut him up!” Finally some one turned the
laugh on the affair, after getting permission to speak.</p>

<p class='c007'>“People around here wouldn’t understand us if we
tried to go through all those motions. Can’t you tell
us something easier?” Mr. Robertson dropped the
matter and began to watch for results thereafter. He
saw none except some crude mockeries of courteous
behavior.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Correct the blunders of this man, by thinking out a
plan of action with some care. If it seems best to make
a public speech on politeness first, point out instances
where the school has shown excellent breeding. Cite
cases of ill-breeding with pupils in another school as
the subjects. Point out prominent persons of the community
who have shown you marked courtesies. Take
up but four or five points at a time, briefly, and with
dignity so as to compel respect. A little raillery need
not be taken seriously, as it may easily conceal genuine
respect for what you propose.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Building on the ground already gained convinces
pupils that the new habits recommended are not a
novelty but an extension of something they already
respect. Only so can unfamiliar customs of courtesy
be introduced, especially if some of the children come
from uncultured homes. It requires real pedagogical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>skill to convince the untaught that acts of courtesy are
not necessarily hypocritical and affected.</p>

<p class='c007'>Good manners come naturally to the adolescent, since
this is the period of display of the person. When once
the novelty can be forgotten there is a warm response
in courteous forms of behavior. Hence, the cautious
teacher does not hold up a pupil to scorn or shame,
but deals gently with him on the assumption that he
knows no better.</p>

<p class='c007'>Imitation is the best agency for teaching courtesy.
An administrator should watch every teacher to ascertain
if he treats the pupils courteously. In bringing
visitors into the school, one can select models of courtesy
and immeasurably stimulate student interest in
good manners.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Dramatizing</div>

<p class='c007'>Arthur Scudder left Vernon College with all the
polish that four years in a coeducational school could
furnish him. He was tall, finely proportioned, perfectly
groomed, easily poised, and fitted to win the
attention of any one who came to know him. Withal,
he was quite unassuming and wore his good manners
with a gracious innocence.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a week at Wellington, he said to himself:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Something is to be done here. These young bloods
and lassies need a little training in good manners. I
believe I’ll try to connect it up with several other matters
and make no separate item of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Accordingly he brought together the English teacher
and the teacher of history for consultation. “I want,”
said the principal, “a play that will exhibit a modern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>situation, involving Americans, in considerable numbers,
on foreign soil. The plot must involve a political
issue and the characters must exhibit very conspicuously
faultless observance of a large number of the
rules of courtesy. Can we find such a thing?”</p>

<p class='c007'>It took a month to answer the question. Finally,
“Ethel Proctor’s Peace” was found, examined and
accepted. The cast required forty-one characters; no
one of them was burdened with a very heavy part. It
suited Mr. Scudder’s purpose entirely. The scene was
at The Hague and the plot interwove fragments of the
great European conflicts, diplomacy and love. It took
two months to prepare it, owing to the chorus practice
that was a necessary feature.</p>

<p class='c007'>Was the principal disappointed in his scheme? By
no means. He coached his pupils with rare enthusiasm
and drilled them into characters they had never
assumed before. He refused to fix the cast finally, until
he had made several shifts; thus he put certain individuals
through some very much needed practice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The effect was marvelous. In fact the entire school
was profoundly molded by the work done in preparing
and giving this splendid play.</p>

<p class='c007'>Children’s eyes follow their interests. Their attention
is absorbed in that which makes the strongest sense
impression. A room full of children can be managed
only by teaching them self-control.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Mapleton primary room was in the hands of a
genius for the first time in years. Miss Tenney was in
her first year of teaching, but had put into it an uncommon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>amount of vim and sense. She sifted out the best
things from new methods and put them through with
tact.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a consequence, early in the year, visitors began
to drop in and observe her work. They were looking
for her weak spot and found it: the boys and girls
could not stick to their work when visitors were present.
For example, Miss Tenney was reported to have
said in Mrs. Wm. Van Kirk’s presence:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Walter and Clarence, go on with your work now.”
“Eleanor and Pearl, don’t look that way. Look at
your book.” “You must go right on with your school
work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was such a delicate matter to handle that no one
dared speak to her about it, so the unfortunate and
unnecessary situation is prevalent to this day.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Give instructions on how to behave when visitors are
present at a time when no stranger is in the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lay the stress on showing some good work to the
friends of the school.</p>

<p class='c007'>Repeat some of the words of praise that have been
spoken regarding “our work,” and promise a good
many more visitors before long.</p>

<p class='c007'>Name the children beavers or bees and tell them
how well they have worked and what they may hope to
accomplish if every child will work hard.</p>

<p class='c007'>Apply the principles of suggestion and approval.
Some morning, say tomorrow morning, when all the
pupils before you are fresh and in a good mood to
have suggestions lodged, rise from your chair, walk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>around in front of your desk, smiling, and say something
like this: “I want to tell you how <i>proud</i> I am
this morning.” Pause at this point, allowing your
pupils to wonder what you are going to say next. Then
continue: “A visitor came in to one of my classes a
few days ago and I noticed a good number of my pupils
kept right on with their work—their heads straight
forward, instead of turning around and bending their
necks out of joint trying to see the visitors, as they do
in some schools. Now, a visitor always notices this. I
went into a school once where everyone twisted his
neck so much that I wondered if there wasn’t something
wrong with all of them. Then I have visited
other schools where the pupils kept right on with their
work and it looked just fine. The teacher seemed to
be proud because the pupils showed such good manners.
I tell you I’m going to watch from now on and when
I see everyone in the room continuing his work when
visitors come, I’ll feel like going to my desk and
raising every one of the grades a notch or two because
it’s a good trait in any school.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The next time a visitor comes, a greater number of
pupils will pay attention to their work than before,
so on the following morning, again approve your
pupils for their good manners in the presence of yesterday’s
visitor, bringing out the point that you noticed
several more yesterday than you ever did before.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the most important points about this method
is that those who stare are practically ignored. They
are not approved nor even talked about. In order for
them to be included in that class which is <i>noticed</i>, they
must fall into line.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>It is important that you spend the smallest amount
of time possible with the visitor when he comes. Simply
show him a good seat and then go about your work as
if he were not present. Many teachers are responsible
for their pupils paying so much attention to the visitor
because they are continually going back and talking
with the visitor, explaining various things to him
during a class recitation. In other words, the direction
of the teacher’s attention largely determines the
direction of the pupil’s attention.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Too much attention can easily be devoted to a small
matter of this sort. Miss Tenney, by a little manipulation,
could have placed this staring at visitors where
it belonged—in a subordinate relation to the remainder
of her work. Her own absorption prevented her from
properly instructing her pupils when guests were absent.
A small neglect of this sort may nearly undo a
very fine piece of work; surely this will be the case
if the children discover that they have free rein under
certain circumstances.</p>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Greeting the Visitor</div>

<p class='c007'>Rose Holden had charge of the Pines Hill district
school for the summer term. Having taught in the
same district in another settlement, she was well known
before her school opened. Visitors came in somewhat
frequently, and provision for courteous treatment of
them was necessary, but such as would not disturb the
school.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>“I wish to make the following announcements about
visitors,” she said one day. “When visitors knock
I will meet them at the door. Since there is no space
for them to sit in the back of the room, I shall bring
them to the front and shall introduce them to the
school. You will stand and say together: ‘We are glad
to see you, Mrs. ——.’ After that you and the visitors
will take seats and you are to go on with your work.
This means that you are to forget that any stranger is
in the room. I shall repeat these instructions now and
then so that all may understand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Holden’s pupils all happened to be small children.
With an older class of pupils she would not have
requested the formality of rising. With the little ones,
however, the act afforded a brief rest for the pupils,
satisfied their desire to share in greeting the visitors
and made them more willing to return quietly to their
study.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 76 (FOURTH GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Gazing at Visitors</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Olney had heard that her new room in Virden
was not a very good one, but she had no idea how awkward
and ill-bred children could be until she saw their
actions on the first day, when two mothers and one
father came with new pupils to the school. Visitors
were evidently a new experience for this third grade
room, for the pupils stared constantly at the trio
seated on the platform, where they had been placed
with much politeness by Miss Olney.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ll have to pardon the way those children stare
at you,” she said to the visitors. “They don’t seem
to be used to company. Children, let’s see every eye
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>on the lessons, now. It isn’t polite to stare at company.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The children opened their books, and gazed at them
unseeingly. Miss Olney turned to Mr. Turner, whose
little daughter was a new pupil, and explained to him
the course she would take. “We don’t have history in
this room, I’m sorry to say. Perhaps we can put it in
later. Harvey, do you have your problems? Then
why don’t you go to work? Our guests are not visiting
you; they are visiting the room, and they want to
see the room at work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Presently she turned to Mrs. Albright, another of
the trio, and began to explain her ideas of teaching.
But in the midst of her explanations she saw Mary
Hill and Sara Bly watching her and her guest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mary and Sara, this is time to get lessons. Dear
me, Mrs. Albright, I do hope you’ll come to see us
later, when we have learned to be better behaved.
These children certainly do need some training, and
I intend to give it to them. Look at those little Johnsons;
they are fairly staring a hole through you, Mrs.
Young.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Young laughed with her at the staring little
Swedes, who quickly looked at their books in confusion
at the evident discussion of them, and flushed very red.
Feeling that they were interfering with the program
of the school, the three visitors soon left, and then Miss
Olney was freer to give her attention to her pupils.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now see here,” she began, “there is one thing we
might as well understand first as last. When company
comes, I want you to go right on with your regular
work, and <i>I’ll</i> entertain the visitors. Above all else,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>don’t stare at them. You get your lessons, or else you’ll
fail right before company, and then think how ashamed
you’ll be. I know you all want to show off before company,
don’t you? And instead of showing off, you all
look as countrified and awkward as a lot of little geese,—just
as though you never had company at home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Olney did not have much company during the
year, but when she did she went through about this
program each time. Her pupils did not improve in
manners; at the end of the year they were as awkward,
self-conscious and ill-bred as in the beginning. She
had utterly failed because she did not know that good
manners are largely taught through imitation.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Usher guests quietly into the room, and place chairs,
or allow pupils to place chairs for them in some part
of the room where their presence will not interfere with
school activities. Talk to them, if at all, so quietly
that pupils will not be disturbed in their work. Go
on with school work as though guests were not present;
they want to see the school routine. Your own quiet
acceptance of the presence of guests will help the
pupils to regard the visit as less of an event. If the
children stare at guests, attract their attention by some
exercise or talk to them about their work, or let them
do some favorite task that appeals to them strongly.
Then, when the company has gone, talk to them frankly
about the matter of staring, and show them how much
more courteous it is not to look at people intently.
Never talk about your pupils to visitors, unless you
can say something pleasant of them; and even compliments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>should be paid with caution, as the sweet grace
of unconsciousness is easily spoiled in little people.
By your own easy, matter-of-fact politeness to guests,
set the pupils a good example to imitate.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Olney made several mistakes. First of all, she
made her pupils very conscious of the visitors by putting
them upon the platform and spending her time
during lesson-hours talking to them. Company should
never be put upon a platform unless they are to be
looked at; for any child feels that an unusual object,
placed directly before him, must be meant to be seen.
Miss Olney had no business asking her pupils to do
what she did not herself do; she spent her time with the
visitors, neglecting her regular program, but asked her
pupils to attend to their lessons. She should have
known that voluntary attention is weak in early childhood,
and needs every help to growth. She made
Harvey, Sara, Mary and the little Johnsons very self-conscious
by correcting them before guests, then reproved
them for not going on with their work in complete
unconsciousness of anything unusual. In short,
she ignored the value of example in every way.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dramatic exercises are a most effective means of
reaching small children, since they offer the elements
of vividness and repetition.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (RURAL SCHOOL)</h4>

<p class='c016'>“Hey, there, teacher!” called out Johnny Scott to
Miss Strong, whom he spied across the road. “Say,
you didn’t lick me today, did you? Pa said you would,
but I told him where he got off at.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Loud Manners</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>The men lounging before the postoffice laughed good-naturedly
as Johnny yelled this greeting to his teacher.
She was embarrassed, but not angry, for she knew
Johnny and fine manners had never had a fair chance
to become acquainted. She dreaded going to the postoffice
for her letters, but as she could not have them
without making the trip, she finally mustered up courage
and ran the gauntlet of staring idlers. One of
them, Ike Masters, spoke to her as she came out.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, the first day’s done, ain’t it?” he asked with
kindly interest. “An’ you ain’t sorry, now, I’ll bet.
If my boy gives you any trouble just lick the stuffing
out of him, an’ I’ll do it again when he gits home if
I’ve hearn about it.” His friends nodded and guffawed
their approval, and Miss Strong escaped with a
murmur and a smile. The smile came because she
realized that these mountain people were kindly disposed
toward her and her work, and that their crudeness
was that of ignorance and not that of viciousness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are going to play a game,” she announced the
next day, when regular lessons were done and the
happy play-hour had come. “We’re going to play we
are going along the street, and meet each other. We’ll
practice the right way to greet our friends.” She told
a little story of a boy who started out one morning
and met various people,—a lady, whom he greeted
with lifted hat; an old man, whose basket he carried;
a stranger, whom he directed; and a lost baby, whom
he took home to his mother. She illustrated graphically
the various stages in this small paragon’s progress,
and then asked who wanted to play that he was Ben
Blossom (the name of the model boy). Two hands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>went up; really all wanted to play, but games were a
new thing and the children were shy. So these two
boys were allowed to put on their hats and play the
little drama of good manners. She herself took the
part of the woman, and greeted the boy who lifted his
hat with sweet courtesy. She hobbled along like an
old man, with her satchel for a basket, and she selected
the smallest girl to be the lost baby. They were all
so excited about the play that they forgot to stop at
four o’clock; and Miss Strong promised that they
might play it again.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they played it the second time, Bob Everly
took the part of Ben, and Dicey Snively was the lady.
“Good morning, Miss Snively,” Bob called out cheerily
as soon as he entered the room. “How d’ you do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aw, that ain’t the way to do it,” Bud Hawkins
complained.</p>

<p class='c007'>“’Tis too,” returned Bob, hotly. “Ain’t it, Miss
Strong?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let’s talk about that,” said Miss Strong. “Bob,
do you think Ben Blossom shouted at the lady as soon
as he saw her, or did he wait until he was near her and
then spoke in a rather low voice?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He waited!” Bud Hawkins put in virtuously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know,” said Bob. “What <i>did</i> he do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He waited until he had almost reached her, and
then he lifted his hat with the hand that was on the
other side of her. See if you can show Bud just how
it was done.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Bob did it beautifully. “Now,” said Miss Strong,
“I want to see if you can bow and lift your hats to
me, next time you pass me on the road, as nicely as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>Ben Blossom did to that lady he knew. And you’ll
wait until you are near me before you begin to tell
me things, won’t you? I like that so much better
than calling out to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My pop don’t lift his hat,” said Bud. “He says
it’s stuck-up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think it’s stuck-up <i>not</i> to lift your hat,” said the
new teacher. “If you don’t lift your hats, I might
think you didn’t like me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By means of such little plays Miss Strong taught
her mountain boys and girls the more obvious points
of good manners. Gradually they learned not to shout
to her across the road, to address her by name instead
of by the title “Teacher,” and to raise their caps
punctiliously when she passed. A few of the fathers,
as eager as their children to learn the ways of the
world, also learned to salute her courteously; but most
of them merely tolerated this innovation as a harmless
fancy of the new teacher’s.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>The use of the dramatic method in dealing with
faults based on the exercise of imitative faculties has
these recommendations:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>1.</dt>
    <dd>It presents the new ideal for imitation vividly; it brings it before the children in 
    action, with words and gestures.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.</dt>
    <dd>It overcomes the physical inertia of unusedness through practice. Any one can remember 
    cases in his own childhood in which he resolved to do a certain thing, but failed when 
    the chance came through sheer lack of practice; the unschooled <span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>muscles refused 
    to do a new, strange thing. Teachers should be careful to practice the game several times 
    before suggesting that the action be made a part of daily life.
    </dd>
    <dt>3.</dt>
    <dd>It gives a pleasant association to the new idea; the association of play is far more 
    pleasant than that of didactic instruction. Games and plays can be made very interesting 
    and little children love them.

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION 2 (THIRD GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Slouching</div>

<p class='c007'>Another example of the effectiveness of the teacher’s
own influence in correcting bad habits formed through
imitation, is the experience of a teacher in a primary
room in Ohio. She noticed the bad posture of her
little people on the first day, but was not surprised, as
she had known her predecessor to be a woman of
slouchy appearance and stooped shoulders, although
an excellent teacher in other respects. She said nothing
about posture for two weeks, although she took
especial pains to stand and sit correctly herself. She
hoped that her silent example would effect a change.</p>

<p class='c007'>Silent example does sometimes effect a change, without
the need of any word. This is when the imitators
are either startled into attention through the spectacular
nature of the model offered, or are sensitive
to differences in models. In this case the children did
not even notice that their new teacher stood differently
from their former one, for they were not at all sensitive
to the difference between good and bad postures.
So Miss Sturdevant began to make her example effective
by making it vivid.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>“I want you to look at me a moment,” she said one
morning, as she seated herself before her pupils with
her profile turned to them. “Please notice my shoulders.
Do you see anything wrong with them?” She
was badly round-shouldered at that moment. But the
children were so completely unconscious of the problem
to be dealt with that they saw nothing wrong.
So Miss Sturdevant straightened her shoulders
quickly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you like to see my shoulders this way, or as they
were before?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We like you this way,” one little boy volunteered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Sturdevant again rounded her shoulders,
straightened them, and showed them how much better
she looked with her chest well out and her shoulders
back, than when humped over. When the children had
become sensitive to the difference in her appearance,
she called their attention to their own round shoulders
and crowded chests. There followed a great straightening
up, of course. The teacher drew two pictures
upon the blackboard, one showing chest and shoulders
in a good position, and the other showing a boy
badly humped over his desk. Under the first she
wrote: “This boy will have a good figure when he
grows up.” Under the second she wrote: “What
kind of a figure will this boy have?” When all this
had been done, the children began to notice Miss
Sturdevant’s erect posture, and to straighten up
when she threw her chest out or held her shoulders
back suggestively.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the first matter of correct sitting posture had
been made clear by repeated example and explanation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>good standing posture was taken up, then position
when lying in bed, sitting in an ordinary chair and so
forth. In every case, example was clarified by explanation
and reasons were given. As Miss Sturdevant was
a sweet and attractive woman and loved by her pupils,
they eagerly followed her example and directions, and
the bad effects of the former imitation were practically
eliminated by the end of the year.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes imitation and instruction can be effectively
reinforced by suggestion and approval. For
example, some morning when the pupils are fresh
and in a good frame of mind to accept suggestion, the
teacher might say: “I want to tell you how proud I
am this morning” (pausing, allowing the pupils to
wonder what will come next), then continue: “A
visitor came into one of my classes a few days ago and
I noticed a good number of my pupils sitting up just
as straight as could be, with their shoulders back like
this.” (Here she should put her shoulders back decidedly.)
“Now, a visitor always notices this. I have
visited some schools where the pupils didn’t seem to
have good postures at all, while in other schools where I
have visited, the pupils were all healthy looking, robust,
with big, broad shoulders kept well back. They
made a fine appearance. I’m going to watch from now
on and just see how many I can count who keep their
shoulders back. It’s mighty fine to see everyone in the
room sitting up straight. I like to see a straight
physique and I am going to tell you tomorrow morning
how many I count today.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The next morning the teacher should again approve
the pupils regarding how straight they sat the day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>before, bringing out the fact that she noticed several
more yesterday than ever before.</p>

<p class='c007'>The skillful use of imitation is a particularly good
means of bettering conditions in schools in which there
is no real badness, but in which quietness and order
are absent. It is not enough that children mean well;
they must also learn to work economically and efficiently,
or they are not being educated truly. One
reason for the noisy school-room is that quietness has
not been held before American children as a universal
need. There have been teachers enough who have insisted
on a death-like solemnity in school-room routine,
but few that have seen that training in quietness must
have a bigger end in view than mere school-room order.
Young people, having strong nerves and stronger
motor impulses, are not naturally quiet; therefore,
the advantage of quietness must be shown them conclusively,
and ways of being quiet, of doing things
without unnecessary noise, must be made concrete by
illustration. With the desirability for quiet and the
definite ways of attaining it both made clear to them,
imitation of quiet ways of accomplishing their ends
will follow.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 77 (SIXTH GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Quiet Manners</div>

<p class='c007'>After three weeks’ work following the holidays,
Miss Herbert found school-room conditions in Farmerstown
gradually declining. A series of annoyances
was instituted; certain troubles seemed to become the
fashion, then die and give place to new ones, none very
serious but all disconcerting. Awaking finally to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>situation, she decided to watch for the next outbreak
and deal with it severely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Louis Fischer, you dropped your pencil on purpose,
I just believe!” and before she was done with
the sentence another and another went clattering on
the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her eye fell next on Arthur Boyd. “Now, Arthur,
I’ve stood this just as long as I can. You two can
just as well begin behaving properly at once. Get up,
both of you! Stand on your seats until I give you
permission to get down.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With open-mouthed wonder, the two mounted their
seats as ordered and watched with glee the complete
absorption of the other pupils in this novel sight.
Some pretence of work was maintained for fifteen
minutes until the two were ordered down from their
seats.</p>

<p class='c007'>The results were not satisfactory. The children
felt somewhat insulted at this form of punishment, at
the same time some of them wanted to star as the object
of general attention.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>The best remedies for noises of this sort are intense
drive on interesting work, and indifference to the
noise, if there is an apparent concerted movement to
annoy the teacher.</p>

<p class='c007'>In case you find it needful to speak privately to any
pupil, assume that his motives are good all the way
through and that he would like to lay his pencil down
properly. Perhaps the following words will be appropriate:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>“I see you have some difficulty in keeping your
pencil. My own desk has a slant and sometimes gives
me trouble on that account. If we will lay our pencils
down carefully in the groove, they will surely stay
where they belong.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>For these minor noises it seems safe to recommend
for children in any grade the methods just outlined.
Nothing is surer to provoke disrespect for a teacher
than excessive attention to small annoyances. On the
other hand the best remedy for these trifling troubles
is plenty of hard work.</p>

<p class='c007'>In nearly every instance the noisy pupil is not a
vicious child, but an active child. Let us recall how
eagerly children produce interminable noises of all
sorts when left to their own devices—banging, whistling,
drumming, screeching noises. In school hours
the noise-hunger takes secondary place. The pleasure
of creating a sensation is the chief cause of the annoyance.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (FIFTH GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Experiments</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miller came into a very noisy fifth grade room,
where the pupils were good-natured and docile, but
unused to orderly methods and untrained in self-control.
She won their liking at the outset by her courtesy
and her real mastery of her teaching subjects; therefore
she found herself in a good position, after the
first fortnight of establishing her authority, to attack
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>her great problem of reducing the school-room routine
to quietness and economy of nerve-force.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I want you to help me make an experiment,” she
said one day. “Yesterday was a rainy day, and we
had more than the usual amount of noise, I think.
You spent the whole of your twenty minutes in studying
your mental arithmetic, and yet you made eighty-two
mistakes out of a total of one hundred thirty
questions; I kept count carefully. That was too many
by far, wasn’t it? I tried to think how we could bring
up our bad record, and I decided that we make too
much noise in study hour. So I thought we would
experiment, and see if we can get our arithmetic better
when we are quiet. I’m going to select ten pupils
today, and let them go off by themselves in quiet places
to study by themselves. Who wants to go? And the
rest of us here will be as quiet as we can be, and we’ll
see what the effect will be on our lessons.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The children were eager for the novelty of an “experiment,”
and of course it proved to them, as Miss
Miller planned it should, that quietness brings better
lessons and that they are learned in less time.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wonder if we can reduce the time spent on our
arithmetic lesson to fifteen minutes, and thus have
five minutes more for our music, or for the story
hour?” she said. “Of course, we shall need to have
the room very quiet, to do that. Who can suggest
ways in which we can control the noise during study
hours?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Many suggestions came from the children. “We
can remember not to move our feet around after we
have placed them on the floor.” “At home, when baby
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>is asleep, mother has us walk on tiptoe if we have to
cross the room.” “We can have it quiet if everybody
makes up his mind not to whisper once.” “I keep
dropping my pencil on the floor, and I’ve thought of
a way to stop that. I’m going to have a string on it
and fasten it to my buttonhole, and then if it does drop
it can’t reach the floor and make a clatter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Miller suggested other ways, and they made a
list of them on the blackboard, so as to keep them all
in mind. Under the teacher’s sympathetic leadership,
there ensued a campaign to eliminate noise from study hours.
Without mentioning it, Miss Miller enlarged
the scope of their efforts to include quieter ways of
passing materials, walking about the room, and putting
away books. Mutual imitation strengthened the
movement; just as these pupils had before imitated
the thoughtless, careless, noisy way of doing things,
now they imitated a thoughtful, controlled method of
accomplishing results. What mischievous noise there
had been disappeared automatically through the force
of public opinion; for when the room as a whole saw
the results of a quiet regime, saw that it brought them
more time for the recreational part of the school program,
a prejudice against unnecessary noise developed
which rendered the maker thereof unpopular.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Do not treat noise as a crime. Consider it a disease,
or rather a lack of development, a failure to acquire
a desirable skill. Follow this plan:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>1.</dt>
    <dd>Show that quiet is really a desirable thing for the pupils themselves—too often they have 
    an <span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>idea that it is merely a cranky demand of the teacher’s, with which, of 
    course, being healthy young animals, they have little sympathy.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.</dt>
    <dd>In a spirit of coöperation, devise and clarify means of securing quiet habits. Show the 
    pupils how to lift their feet in walking, do not simply command them to walk quietly. If 
    pencils fall, have them tied. Teach pupils how to handle books, pencils, tablets (in 
    really up-to-date schools the dirty, noisy slates are no longer used) and erasers, so as 
    to minimize the chances of their falling on the floor. If pupils fall noisily into their 
    seats, show them how well-bred men and women sit. They will never learn anything more 
    valuable than these lessons in good manners, even if an occasional spelling lesson has to 
    be sacrificed for them.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c007'>Not infrequently it happens that what, on the face
of it, appears to be bad manners or impatience, is
really due to pathological nervousness. In such a
case the teacher has a further duty than the mere
teaching of good manners.</p>

<p class='c007'>The impatient child is but a nervous child. Nervous
children often spill and drop things and are easily
excited. What will tend to control and quiet one condition
will control and quiet the other. Firmness will
be needed in either case.</p>

<p class='c007'>Find out the cause of the pupil’s nervousness if possible
and seek to remove that cause. You may need to
speak to the parent. Approach him or her in a kind
spirit which the parent can not possibly mistake. Suggest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>that you noticed some point about the child’s
behavior at school which perhaps the parent had not
as yet observed. Be very careful not to exaggerate
any statement—instead be very conservative. For
example, after commenting on some good point about
Mary, say something like this: “I have noticed that
Mary is beginning to show just a little nervousness at
times and I thought you would appreciate it if I would
tell you. I wondered if she might have eaten too much
candy or too many rich things, or whether she might
have failed to get enough sleep.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This method will bring about the coöperation of the
mother, who will do all in her power to help you with
the child. You can, in the course of your conversation
with the mother, incidentally remark that you
have always found that a daily warm bath, plenty of
rest, some exercise, and plenty of fresh air will generally
make a pupil feel like himself or herself again.
Avoid the suggestion that the nervousness is at all
serious with this child; assume, rather, that this is just
a little time in which the pupil is not feeling as well
as usual.</p>

<p class='c007'>At school, see to it that the nervous child gets plenty
of exercise on the playground and plenty of fresh
air in the school-room. It is also very important that
you say pleasing things to the nervous child, words
which have a soothing effect. Even strain a point to
approve the work which the pupil does. Faultfinding
will unnerve a child more quickly than almost anything
else. So be very patient and encourage the
pupil even more than you would an ordinary child.
The impatient child tends to get through with his work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>before other children do. The teacher should always
have at hand some pictures, picture books, boxes of
curios, colored pencils, stencils, colored blocks, building
blocks and many other things that interest children
in primary grades. But whatever the grade of the
nervous child, avoid so far as possible all sources of
irritation; never lose a chance to commend effort; let
your attitude toward him be one of sympathy.</p>

<p class='c007'>(9) <i>Cleanly habits and care of school-room.</i> Every
first grade teacher knows what it is to have one or
more pupils who are disposed to be uncleanly. This
condition can not be termed a misdemeanor. It is
more. It is both annoying and unsanitary. What is
still worse is that the situation is not one of the child’s
own choice, but it is due to circumstances in the home;
and too often, any measure that is taken to reform the
child gives offense to the parents. If parents do not
know what cleanliness really is, how can they teach it
to their children?</p>

<p class='c007'>Appeal to personal pride. This can be done without
the pupils knowing that the teacher is making an
effort in that direction. The teacher may give a talk
about a clean school-room and incidentally say:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cleanly <i>pupils</i> live in cleanly school-rooms. I am
proud of all my boys and girls when they keep their
clothes and themselves clean.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She can give some little talk about cleanliness each
day for several weeks and in a casual manner make
the application to the pupils. By thus appealing to
their pride most cases of uncleanness will be remedied.</p>

<p class='c007'>In very stubborn cases the teacher can have a private
talk with the pupil. Should there be more than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>one such pupil, the teacher must not make the mistake
of talking to both at one time; that would humiliate
each, and hurt the pride of both.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the little boy who is in the habit of keeping his
face and hands soiled, the teacher may say:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have such red cheeks, Harold! What silky
hair and what lovely little hands you have! I like to
see hair like yours combed this way!” and then she
can comb the little boy’s hair in an attractive way.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How I do like to see red cheeks like yours, round
and clean!” Then the teacher can kindly wash the
child’s face and hands and comment on how fine they
look. With a little straightening of the boy’s collar
she may say, “Oh, Harold, how sweet you look!” If
she has a small mirror she may let the boy see himself.
Finally, she may propose that he do this each morning
before he comes to school. To please the boy she may
say:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, I am going to walk home with you because
you look so fine.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the way home she should talk about the things
they see. When she comes to the home, she may bid
the boy a cheery “Good night, Harold.” Should she
see flowers in the yard she may say:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Harold, when you come to school tomorrow, I wish
you would bring me one of those flowers to wear on
my waist.” Harold will bring the flower, and the
teacher should wear it with great pride. A teacher
who will do this can win any dirty little urchin to her
and often induce him to make every effort to keep
clean. Several such private lessons may be necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a last resort, but not wholly advisable, because it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>irritates and offends the parents often, is the method
of having a talk with parents and explaining to them
that they are expected to keep their children clean.
One teacher who had a few stubborn cases of uncleanliness,
purchased a wash basin, some soap, and several
towels. Whenever the pupils that were habitually
uncleanly came in she had them wash their faces and
hands and comb their hair. She had little trouble, but
not every teacher could do this.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 78 (SECOND GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Soiled Face</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Gebhard had been teaching in the Lowell
School for a week. Every one of the five days little
Hazel Jordan had been a blemish to the group of beautiful
children with whom she associated. Hazel was
ugly of face, ungainly in movements, dull of intellect
and unaccustomed to the regular use of soap and water.
This was Miss Gebhard’s first year of teaching. She
had read that teachers must see to it that their pupils
have clean hands and faces. During her first week
she was so busy with organizing her school that she
felt unable to cope with lesser problems. As she reviewed
her week’s work and recalled the characteristics
of her various pupils, she said to herself,
“That little Jordan girl must be made cleaner next
week.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Accordingly, on Monday morning when Hazel entered
with dirty hands, face and clothing, Miss Gebhard
said, “Hazel Jordan, go home and wash your
hands and face and come back here clean.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Perfect stillness reigned over the school-room for a
moment after this command was given, and Hazel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>eyeing Miss Gebhard as she went, passed out of the
room and ran breathlessly home.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, Hazel’s mother was a widow who washed so
much for other people that she had neither time nor
strength to care for her own children; besides, Hazel
had few dresses, and on this Monday morning all of
them were soiled. When the child reached home and
told Mrs. Jordan what Miss Gebhard had said, her
mother wept in self-pity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nobody cares how hard I work,” she wailed; “all
the notice I get is to be insulted. You just stay home
from school and I’ll go and see Tom Ellis and ask him
if a widow has got to dress her children up fine before
she can send them to public school.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as the washing she was then doing was “on
the line,” she went to see Mr. Ellis, a member of the
school board, and told him that Hazel had been sent
home from school because she wasn’t dressed up to
suit the teacher.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Gebhard was a little alarmed because Hazel
did not return, and was agitated when she saw Mr.
Ellis, the most influential member of the school board,
standing in the doorway of her school-room. All of
the pupils stared while Mr. Ellis catechized Miss Gebhard
as to why she sent Hazel Jordan home. In vain
she explained that she said nothing about her clothes.
She could see that Mr. Ellis thought she had acted
unwisely, as he reiterated, “Her mother’s a hard-working
widow, you know, and her feelings are
hurt.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It seemed clear to Miss Gebhard that she had blundered.
She called upon Mrs. Jordan, who wept at her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>own poverty and seemed unlikely to be able to distinguish
between cleanliness and richness of dress.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Gebhard decided that the matter of cleanliness
was too difficult for her to handle and made no further
recommendations on the subject during the year.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Examine the hands and faces of several other children
before inspecting Hazel. If more than one needs
to wash his hands, send all to the lavatory, or to the
pump, and ask them to return to the school-room clean.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>If children are spoken to kindly about the condition
of their hands and several are sent at once to wash,
they will take less offense. It will seem then a matter
of school-room practice rather than a personal affront.</p>

<p class='c007'>Drills or plays are often used to bring about habits
of cleanliness.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (FIRST GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>“Sanitary Brigade”</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Barry organized her first grade room into a
“Sanitary Brigade.” Every one’s own ten fingers
were the private soldiers over which each one’s face
was the captain. One child in each row, appointed by
the teacher each Monday morning, was the Lieutenant
General of his row, and Miss Barry was the Major
General of them all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each captain inspected his ten soldiers and demanded
that each one—right and left Thumbkin, right
and left Pointer, right and left Longman, Ringman
and Littleman—be perfectly clean. Then the Colonel
inspected the captains and finally the General had a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>grand review of all the troops. The captains and
colonels made daily inspections. If they failed to do
their work well they were sent to the ranks and new
officers appointed in their places. In other words,
if one did not keep his own hands clean, some one
else was appointed to be inspector and reporter of his
hands. If any one was found with unclean hands or
face, a new colonel was appointed for the row in which
that child was found.</p>

<p class='c007'>Inspection was made every morning and any reported
disorder was remedied in the lavatory. When
there was no further need of scrutiny as to clean hands
and faces and when therefore the game had lost in interest,
a similar game was instituted that required
clean teeth, brushed hair, and clean shoes.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 79 (THIRD GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Use of Handkerchief</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Burr, the third grade teacher, sighed as Elma
Colders passed her handkerchief to her twin sister
Zelma. This was a daily, almost hourly, occurrence.
The handkerchief wasn’t absolutely clean. These
twins seemed to take turns having colds, and Miss
Burr believed the common handkerchief was largely to
blame for the transferred infection, but she dared to
say nothing about it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Near to her desk sat Asa Kramer, who sniffed momentarily
for want of a handkerchief, while Fannie
Black had a habit of often wiping her nose with an
upward stroke that was fast causing her nose to have
a decided skyward slant at the end.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day she saw Morris Millspaugh repeat his habit
of wiping his nose on his coat sleeve and the following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>quotation popped into her head, “Ye gods! Must I
endure all this?” As if in answer to her question,
Annie Daily, in the back row, lowered her head and
used the under side of the bottom of her dress for a
handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My query is answered,” groaned she. “Annie’s
action says, ‘All this? Ay, more!’”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Burr said to a teacher friend, “If I were the
family doctor of these children, I’d be free to give
their mothers a lecture on sanitation, but since I’m
not, I must keep within my prescribed field.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Correct these disgusting habits of your pupils. This
can be done by asking each child to bring a clean handkerchief
every morning. A certain teacher each morning
asked all who received a grade of one hundred in
spelling or arithmetic the day before to stand and walk
to the front of the room. She then asked the other
children <i>who had clean handkerchiefs</i> to give them the
Chautauqua salute, and the children in front were
asked to return this salute. The children enjoyed
this immensely and demanded from their mothers clean
handkerchiefs every morning in order that they might
be allowed to take part in this exercise.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Burr was wrong to conclude that it was not
her business to protect the health of her pupils.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were several beneficial results accompanying
the Chautauqua salute program described above.
Those who did good work were rewarded and those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>who cheered them were given drill in the hard task of
praising their fellows who had succeeded where they
themselves had failed.</p>

<p class='c007'>This salute was given in the morning, so that all
handkerchiefs would be clean for it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Enlist the Mothers</div>

<p class='c007'>Teachers can do no better than tactfully to enlist
the aid of mothers in matters of cleanliness.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (FOURTH GRADE)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Shaw, who taught the fourth grade in a very
poor district in New York City, organized a mothers’
meeting to convene alternate Fridays after school
hours. At one of these meetings she asked a trained
nurse to talk about cleanliness especially.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the nurse had clearly explained the danger of
infection in the care of the nose, a mother who was a
good shopper was delegated to take orders for handkerchiefs
from all present who needed them for their
children, to buy by the dozen and to deliver to the
mothers at cost.</p>

<p class='c007'>By teaching and helping the mothers in this way,
Miss Shaw bettered conditions in her own room and
established a wholesome community spirit among her
patrons.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Decaying Teeth</div>

<p class='c007'>Something was the matter with Dora Payne. Miss
Hubbart, her teacher, was astonished at her stupid
answers and generally inattentive attitude. Usually
Dora was alert and smiling; today she was morose,
even to tearfulness. Miss Hubbart finally said, “What
is the matter, Dora?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>“My tooth aches,” said Dora.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did it ever ache before?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, it ached last week and mamma took me to the
dentist.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Charlotte, you may go with Dora to the dentist to
see if he can stop her toothache,” said Miss Hubbart.</p>

<p class='c007'>The girls were gone only about half an hour, for it
was but a few blocks to the office of the only dentist
in the village. After they came back Dora was relieved
and went on with her school work as usual.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Miss Hubbart returned to the schoolhouse
for the afternoon session that day, she was greeted by
Mr. Payne, Dora’s father, who said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dora says you sent her to Dr. Hammond’s office
today.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, she was suffering with toothache.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What I want to know is, who is going to pay the
bill?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Surely you wouldn’t want Dora to suffer with
toothache.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That tooth has troubled Dora before and my wife
took her to Dr. Hammond and he said that she’d lose
this tooth in a year or so, and we concluded not to
have it worked on. When she gets her last set of
teeth it will not be money thrown away to have them
filled.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you wouldn’t want Dora to suffer for a year,
surely.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Maybe we know how to take care of our own child
without the help of a stranger. I’ll thank you to keep
on your own ground after this.” And Mr. Payne

<p class='c007'>Teachers should never send children to a doctor
without the consent of their parents. A teacher’s help
can be rendered in instituting preventive measures
better than in administering or advising curative remedies.
The harm done to the teeth by allowing them
to decay through the use of improper food, also the
proper use of the tooth brush, and the value of a sterilizing
mouth wash can easily be taught and come within
the teacher’s legitimate province. In many towns she
may also secure the coöperation of the school nurse.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Scattering Paper</div>

<p class='c007'>Merrill MacFarland was elected to a position as
teacher of the fourth grade after three years of experience
in the country schools. He had found the circumstances
in his former situation very unsatisfactory,
and resolved that since he was entering upon
work in a graded school, he would have some things
different. Looking over the room after he had wrestled
his way through the first week, and recalling the
events of the past five days, he was strongly reminded
of his former school experience, since there was really
a disgraceful amount of waste paper all over the
floor. The janitor had been complaining about the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>matter, but MacFarland had been too busy with other
matters to give attention to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Monday morning, after the opening exercises, he
made this announcement:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, I want every one of you boys and girls just
the moment you have a piece of waste paper in your
hand to go to the wastebasket and throw it in. Last
Friday our room was a perfect disgrace. On every
desk there were slips of torn-up paper and some whole
sheets. We can’t get along this way. George, you
just this moment dropped a piece of paper in the
aisle there at your left. Pick it up at once and put
it in the wastebasket as I just told you.” George
noisily moved his slow frame according to the order,
hardly imagining what would be the case if the
teacher’s idea were literally carried out and no more
waste papers were thrown upon the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as he had reached the basket, Mr. MacFarland
discovered that there were several pieces of paper
on the floor in different parts of the room, and said,
“Each one look about his desk now and see if there is
any rubbish on the floor that should be taken away.
If so, pick it up at once and throw it into the basket
as I told you. This is the thing to do at any time when
you want to throw something away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It need hardly be said that, with a great bustle,
each one made the desired search, and about nine
pupils soon were on their way to the basket with
something or almost nothing that needed to be thrown
away.</p>

<p class='c007'>However unsatisfactory the noisy method had
proved, it did bring about the condition desired, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>at the end of the day there was really nothing that
needed to be complained of regarding the cleanliness
of the room, so far as waste paper was concerned.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>A wise teacher does not make so much ado about one
aspect of school-room management. Mr. MacFarland
could easily have foreseen that he was introducing
another evil along with his reform. Reverse the
process. Arrange that the wastebasket be passed
around mid-way between intermissions according to
a definite schedule. Let the passing of the basket be
a privilege that is handed down from one pupil to
another according as they are seated, beginning with
the pupil who sits to the extreme right of the teacher’s
desk. One pupil each day is appointed as guardian
of waste. The privilege and honor will be appreciated,
and with a word of caution, the service can be performed
with the very slightest interruption.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following instructions might be properly given
to the children when the new system is established:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are going to save time as much as possible.
Four times every day we shall pass the wastebasket
and you may put into it whatever you have on hand to
be thrown away. Nothing is to be said to the person
who carries the basket. He will go quietly, promptly,
passing down the aisles, doing a favor to everyone in
the room by his careful attention to this matter.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>It is of the utmost importance that the necessary
organization of school-room conduct be established according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>to principles and policies that are useful to the
child at home and in other situations outside of school
life. He must be taught how to economize his own
time, and the attention of his fellows, how to do necessary
things in a way that shall be both effective and
unobtrusive.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the handling of waste is a small affair for
one room in a school, taken on a larger scale for home,
state and nation, the problem of waste is big enough
to command the attention of every citizen; therefore,
to dispose of the matter properly in school is a valuable
lesson in civics and economics.</p>

<p class='c016'>Supt. Kennelworth suffered the inconvenience of
moving from an old building into the new one near
the middle of a school year.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Bags for Paper</div>

<p class='c007'>In the final plans for the proper use of the new
plant, it had been agreed that each pupil must bring
with him a small waste-paper bag to be attached to
each desk. There were no very definite rules as to its
size, but the warning was given that it must not be
too large for the convenience of all concerned.</p>

<p class='c007'>The matter was brought up only once, each teacher
making the announcement in his own room according
to the superintendent’s instructions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wallace Jackson made his announcement for the
fifth and sixth grades as follows: “Each one of you
is to bring a small, neatly made waste-paper bag, barely
large enough to hold what you think is the waste paper
that gathers at your desk every day. Are there any
questions about this?” A hand went up and the question
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>was asked, “Who is going to empty these bags?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” said Mr. Jackson, “you will empty them
yourselves. Just before the close of school each day
the wastebasket will be passed; your bags will be laid
down upon your desk, and in just a very few minutes
every bag will be emptied and placed in your desk.
Any more questions?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Another hand and another question, “How are we
going to decide who will carry the basket?”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was answered by the statement: “I shall appoint
some pupil to this task every day. The method
of selection will be announced to you later. The only
matter I want now to tell you about is the making of
the bags. Further details will be given to you when
we actually begin our work next Thursday in the
new building.” Owing to the fact that some success
in keeping a neat room had been attained already in
the old building, Mr. Jackson’s announcement was
received without surprise or anxiety.</p>

<p class='c007'>(10) <i>Imitation of wrong social standard.</i> There
is an imitation of mere precedent which is a sort of
social instinct, that can best be handled socially. This
is because the responsibility can be fixed on no one
individual, and as all the members of the group are
equally guilty, all should share in the needed lesson.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 82 (RURAL SCHOOL)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Dropping Shot</div>

<p class='c007'>George Marston went into the country as teacher
in a school in which there had been much bad order.
The directors were in earnest; they wanted a good
school, but for the salary they offered they had not
been able to secure a man who could handle the big
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>boys who made the trouble. They were not especially
bad boys; but the tradition of mischief in the school
was so persistent that no teacher had been able to
overcome it.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the fall term there was no trouble, for then
only meek little girls and small boys attended. But
on the first Monday after Thanksgiving, corn-shucking
being over, the older pupils came in an avalanche
of good-natured noise. The room, before so sparsely
populated by a few pupils, seemed to overflow with
their energy. Trouble was not long in coming, and
it took the shape of a shower of fine shot, which pattered
down from the ceiling during the spelling lesson.
George knew that the hour of trial had come, and he
called out bravely:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who did that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no response. The little girls were peeping
timidly from their books, but the big boys and
girls frankly relished the coming fun.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We may as well settle it now,” said George Marston.
“We can’t have a school without good order.
Of course I want to be just, and first of all I want to
know who threw that shot. Will you tell me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>No one spoke. Then the teacher went around the
room, asking each one in turn if he had done it. Every
one denied it. There was clearly an understanding
among the pupils that gave the teacher no chance.</p>

<p class='c007'>So Marston gave it up for the time being, and lessons
were taken up again. But at four o’clock he asked
four of the leading boys, those he suspected most, to
stay after school. When the rest had gone, he conducted
an exhaustive examination, trying to find who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>was responsible for the disturbance. The evidence
was flippant, contradictory, mockingly frank; but he
found out nothing. Still with his idea of locating the
offense in one person, George held another trial the
next night, with the same result. Then he took the
matter to the board.</p>

<p class='c007'>“One or two persons must have thrown that shot,”
he said to the board members, “and if I can find the
person who did it, and make an example of him, then
I know I can manage the school without trouble. But
so far I can’t find the offender. There doesn’t seem
to be a ringleader; they all hang together so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why can’t you find the offender?” asked one
member.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because they all lie about it—at least there’s one
person who is lying. If only I could find that one
person!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why not lick them all, since they’re all mixed up
in it?” This director was a coarsely practical man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because one person did the deed, and he ought to
bear the punishment,” George replied. “If I keep my
eyes open and wait, in time I’ll be sure to catch the
boy that threw that shot.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So he waited and kept his eyes open, but he never
discovered the shot-thrower. There was much more
misbehavior during the days that followed, and the
struggle to keep even a semblance of order made the
term a nightmare to the harassed teacher. Little real
work was accomplished. The board, anxious to have
a good school, but ignorant of principles and methods,
saw its desire come to nothing. Marston’s ideas of
discipline seemed to be centered on “making an example”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>of some one offender, and the school took a
mischievous satisfaction in shielding each offender
from discovery.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Explosion</div>

<p class='c007'>The crisis came late in January. Marston had just
put a full scuttle of coal on the blazing fire in the big
stove, when a sharp noise and a great puff of smoke
and flame burst from it. The explosion broke apart
the sections of the stove, and a serious fire was averted
with some difficulty. When they had made things
safe and could look at each other with smoke-grimed
faces, teacher and pupils knew that a reckoning was at
hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“John Coffey, you brought in that coal. Did you
put the gunpowder in it?” John was fairly cool,
and the reckless boys had been cowed and sobered by
the extent of the mischief that had been done.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir, I didn’t,” replied John; and his denial
rang true.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you, Carl?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Marston went around the circle, as he had many
times before; and all denied their guilt. Finally Marston
turned to the school.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may all go home now. We can’t have school
until this mess is cleaned up, of course. I shall see the
board at once.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The board decided, at a called meeting, that it would
best get a new teacher, and Marston resigned with
infinite relief. The board sent to a state normal school,
explained the situation, and asked for a strong man.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (RURAL SCHOOL)</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The president of the normal school sent them Isidor
Thomberg, a man of experience and high scholarship.
He came with the understanding that the board was to
support whatever he did, and he agreed to reduce the
school to order. He was confident, fearless, and told
no one of his plans. But he did meet the board on
the night of his arrival, and heard their full account
of the troubles.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next morning school opened as usual, with the
new teacher and the new stove dividing the honors of
attention. Mr. Thomberg made just one reference to
the situation:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course you know why I’m here,” he said. “I
want to say one thing. I shall never waste a moment’s
time trying to find out who does anything bad. We
have to make up for a great deal of lost time this
winter; you’ll have to work hard from now until
spring. We shall have no school but a good one. Now
we’ll go to work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Under the stimulus of his quiet confidence, the order
was excellent that first day. The school needed organization,
and much time was spent in showing the
pupils economical ways of doing things. While the
novelty lasted there was no tendency to disorder, and
when things settled down into a regular routine the
lessons proved so interesting under Mr. Thomberg’s
teaching that the boys forgot for a time to have fun
in the old way. A fancy skating club had been organized;
a new era seemed to have dawned, when one day,
quite unexpectedly, the old problem popped up again.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>A row of pupils, coming quietly forward to the recitation
bench, found themselves stepping on a number
of match-heads which had been scattered in the aisle.
At the same moment Mr. Thomberg himself, who had
stepped to a window to adjust a shade, exploded
two of these little trouble-makers. Every one looked
up in surprise, for bad order had been almost forgotten.</p>

<p class='c007'>The teacher went to his desk. Very quietly he sent
the class back to their seats. Then he told the pupils to
put away all books, and they obeyed in a dazed way,
afraid of they knew not what.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I told you when I came,” said Mr. Thomberg,
“that we couldn’t have anything but a good school.
The reason that we can’t afford to have bad order is
that we have too much serious work to do. I had
begun to like you all so much that I’m sorry some one
has had to spoil our pleasant beginning. But I meant
what I said. So this school is closed, now, indefinitely.
You are all, without exception, suspended from school
until further notice. You will pass out as you always
do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a breathless silence. Such a thing as
suspending a whole school had never been heard of
before. Mr. Thomberg gave the usual signals, and
the boys and girls passed into the hall as though they
had been at a funeral. Mr. Thomberg went to the
nearest house and called the directors by telephone for
a conference, which was scarcely begun when parents
began to inquire indignantly why their children, guiltless
of dropping match-heads, had been suspended from
school. Mr. Thomberg dictated the answer:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>“Tell them,” he said, “that I have no time to ferret
out the doers of silly little tricks in my school. When
the school gives me the assurance that there’ll be no
more trouble, then we’ll go back to work. Whoever
dropped those match-heads thought the school liked
that sort of thing, and you must show him that he is
mistaken. I am a teacher, not a policeman.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The parents really wanted their children in school,
and guided by the suggestion, skillfully made by the
teacher, they took steps to secure the concerted action
which Mr. Thomberg knew was the remedy for the
evil. He was reading the daily paper in the living
room of his boarding house that evening, when the
response for which he had planned came. There
were seventeen of his twenty-six pupils in the party
which called on him. One of the older boys, Felix
Curry, was spokesman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We came to ask you if you’d have us in school
again,” he said. “All our fathers and mothers want
us to go back, and we’ll be good if you’ll let us. The
boy that threw the match-heads will tell you about it
himself. He told us he would.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is no need of that, although he may do so
privately tomorrow if he wants to. But I should rather
not know who did it, if you’ll all be responsible for its
not happening again. You see, I like you all so much
that I’d hate to know who did so foolish and wrong a
thing. And if you will agree that it is to be a good
school, in which everyone works together in the right
spirit, I’ll agree to stay until the end of the year.
Otherwise I pack my trunk tonight.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The pupils gave ample promises, which were not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>broken. Mr. Thomberg stayed through that year and
the next one also, and had the best school in the county.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>This is an extraordinarily difficult situation. Mr.
Thomberg’s success in dealing with this unusual case
depended first of all on the fact that his knowledge
of pedagogy enabled him to analyze the situation truly.
He saw that the bad order was not caused by any one
pupil, but was the result of a social tradition for which
many persons, in and out of the school, were responsible.
All the pupils upheld the disorder; therefore
all the pupils were dealt with in a group.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the second place he was independent, as a really
first-class teacher can be. He set the standard of behavior,
and required his students to come up to it or
give up school altogether. Had the school declined to
take the social responsibility he asked of them, he
would really have packed his trunk and left. He was
well prepared for his work, and was greatly in earnest
about it, nor did he propose to do what he considered
an undignified thing in probing for evil.</p>

<p class='c007'>His personality was strong enough to set up a new
standard for imitation, and to supplant the old one of
inefficiency and mischief. The problem of order was
for a time swallowed up in the greater one of securing
real mental development in his pupils, and when it did
show itself he treated it as a matter to be dealt with
socially by the pupils. This seemed to put upon them
a responsibility they had been used to having the
teacher assume unaided, and they rose to the new
honors imposed upon them. Mr. Thomberg utilized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>imitation in setting up a new regime, by requiring
united action of his pupils. In this way he met a
psychological situation with psychological weapons.</p>

<p class='c007'>(11) <i>Snobbishness.</i> Snobbishness is a very hard
thing to meet wisely, and a sin which is too easily

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 83 (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Joseph Lescinszky was a tailor in a small Middle
West city, who lived in five small rooms over his shop,
with his wife and seven children. He had plenty of
patronage, for he was a good tailor, but he was unhappy,
for one of the dreams long associated with his
American citizenship had failed to materialize. His
eldest son, Joseph Junior, was in the high school—a
homely, awkward boy with great wistful eyes and an
incurable shyness. He was a good student, but suffered
constantly under the heartless, matter-of-fact
ridicule of his American schoolmates.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Race Prejudice</div>

<p class='c007'>This ridicule was but the echo of the attitude of
the whole community toward the Polish family. They
were the only foreigners in the place, and their appearance,
habits and speech afforded unlimited amusement
to everyone. Men who had had their suits made
by the skillful, little, Polish tailor told funny stories
in which his broken English figured as the chief point,
and their sons and daughters in turn laughed at the
shy and awkward children whom they met at school.</p>

<p class='c007'>No one realized how this ridicule embittered the life
of the tailor until Miss Swainson came to Hovey to
teach in the high school. She took her old cape to the
tailor one day, thriftily planning to have it made into
a coat for school wear; and over the making of the coat,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>tailor and teacher began to discuss Joseph and his
school life. No teacher had ever talked to him about
Joseph before, and the little Pole voiced his feelings
tremblingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My Joseph does not like the school,” he confided.
“He goes because I command him that he shall, but he
has not his heart in it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He does very good work,” comforted Miss Swainson.
“His lessons are always excellent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, the lessons he gets with no trouble. But the
boys, they like him not. They all time make fun on
him, and my poor Joseph is not happy. He is Polack,
they say. It is not true—we are Americans now;
there is the paper,” and he pointed proudly to the
naturalization paper, framed upon the wall.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll see if we can’t make Joseph happy at
school,” Miss Swainson promised. “I’ll see what I
can do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, Miss Swainson was one of the upright, downright
people who go at things directly and openly.
She began a campaign for the kinder treatment of
Joseph Lescinszky, Junior. She had no doubt of her
success.</p>

<p class='c007'>An opportunity for beginning her kindly efforts in
Joseph’s behalf came soon. Joseph was always the
butt for practical jokes, and Charlie Owen was his
particular tormentor. Therefore, when Joseph was
tripped, going to the dictionary, by Charlie’s projecting
toes, she kept Charlie after school and had a serious
talk with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t you see what a contemptible thing it is for
you to tease this bright boy just because he is of Polish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>blood?” she inquired warmly of smiling Charlie Owen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, Miss Swainson, he don’t mind. Everybody
always laughs at those Lescinszkies, and they don’t
care. If they ever showed fight like Americans I guess
we’d let them alone, but they don’t. They’re not
like us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s just why you should treat them better.
They haven’t learned that a boy has to fight in order
to be decently treated,” Miss Swainson returned with
fine scorn.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, ma’am. If they could only learn that, they’d
be all right.” Fine scorn was wasted on Charlie.</p>

<p class='c007'>All Miss Swainson’s efforts ended in this way. Secure
in their feeling that traditional American means
for securing respect were the only ones, smug with
the provincialism of the small town, the school children
continued to express to the alien boy the contempt they
had imbibed from their elders. They merely smiled at
Miss Swainson’s indignant efforts to win justice and
kindness for their Polish schoolmate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Toward the end of the year the young teacher
thought she detected a shade of difference in the
treatment given Joseph. This was due partly to her
constant shaming of the thoughtless cruelty of their
conduct, and partly to the respect he himself won by
his good work in the classroom. But although this
small degree of success comforted her somewhat, she
felt still the defeat of her efforts keenly, not realizing
that a change of conduct based on imitation must come
through a change of example followed.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Miss Swainson’s method did not go deep enough.
Mere protest will occasionally effect a change, but not
often. If she could have gotten behind Charlie Owen’s
attitude, and found its roots, which were probably in
the attitude of some member of his family or a powerful
older friend, she might have truly converted
Charlie to her way of thinking. His statement that
“everybody always laughs at those Lescinszkies,”
might have given her a clue, but she did not realize
that she was only working on the surface.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (RURAL SCHOOL)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Sallie Lou Pinkston came from Mobile, Alabama, to
the small, northern town of Cade Mills, when she was
ten years old. She was the only girl in an adoring
family of brothers—a lovely, sunny-haired child, with
the confidence in her right to rule her world which her
happy family life had given her. She entered the
fifth grade that fall, and scored an immediate success
with the whole room, teacher included. Her southern
accent was a continual source of delight; her matter-of-course
assumption that everyone wanted to do the entertaining
things she planned kept the whole room,
with two exceptions, tied to her dainty apron-strings.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two exceptions were Laurastine and Enameline
Flack. Laurastine and Enameline belonged to the one
colored family in town, and they had always attended
the public school and had always been well treated by
the other children. But when Sallie Lou cast her
golden charm over the room, things changed. Sallie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>Lou didn’t understand why they should be there at
all, and she surely didn’t intend to tolerate them as
her social equals. Led by the irresistible charm of
Sallie Lou, vying with each other to stand in her
graces, the other children began to ignore the two little
colored girls, or openly to laugh at them and pointedly
to leave them out of their games.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Stone, the teacher, being a northern woman
and a believer in literal democracy, thought this a very
bad state of things indeed. The two little girls were
well behaved, wistful, little creatures, whose tears at
the new turn of things went straight to Miss Stone’s
big heart. She knew that the remedy must come in
some way through Sallie Lou, who had caused the
havoc; for there was no possible way to supplant her
dominant influence, nor was such a thing desirable except
for this one cause. Sallie Lou had wakened the
room to a new interest in many things, and in everything
except the treatment of the little “niggers” she
was sweetness and docility itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Could Sallie Lou be converted? Miss Stone tried it,
with doubt in her heart; she knew what prejudice is.
She invited Sallie Lou to her house for supper one
Friday night, and after supper they sat by the fire
and had a long talk about it. Miss Stone presented
the pathetic cases of Laurastine and Enameline as
touchingly as she could, but Sallie Lou merely smiled
divinely and told her, most sweetly, that of course she
wanted to do what was right, but that it wasn’t right
for “niggers” to mix socially with white people, and
that the town should provide a separate school for
them. She was firmly entrenched behind the prejudice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>of her rearing in a community which solved the
problem this way.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Stone reluctantly retreated from the attack,
but she did not give up. She went behind the prejudice
to its support, behind the example to its example.
She cultivated Sallie Lou’s mother, her father, her
four charming brothers. The parents, finding few
cultured people in the little town, welcomed the well-read
teacher and were very cordial to her. When she
had won their respect and liking, Miss Stone asked
for a frank talk with them about the conditions in her
room, and told them just how the irresistible Sallie
Lou was leading all the other children in the fifth grade
to snub the two little Flacks.</p>

<p class='c007'>At first the Pinkstons were amused, then they were
indignant. They too felt that the two colored children
had no business in a school for white children. But
when Miss Stone had shown them that a separate
school was impracticable in a town that had but one
colored family, that conditions were very different
from those of a southern city, and that a change in
Sallie Lou’s attitude would avert a personal tragedy
for two innocent little girls, the parents came finally
to see the matter from her point of view. They promised
to talk to Sallie Lou and to persuade her to
change her tactics. Miss Stone thanked them, and
changed the subject quickly and brightly to something
else.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sallie Lou, at first with formal and awkward condescension,
but later with the same frank charm that
won everyone to her, asked the two little outcasts back
into the fold of fifth grade fun. The rest fell easily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>into their old democratic way of sharing things. Miss
Stone had solved the problem of race prejudice by
changing the example.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Play—A Second Form of the Adaptive
Instincts</p>

<p class='c012'>The child never reveals his whole nature as he does when
playing. His physical, mental and moral powers are all called
then into vigorous exercise. On the playground the boy begins
to learn how to struggle with his fellow men in the great battle
of life. His strength and his weakness both manifest themselves
there, so that it pays to study him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Much school trouble is caused by the purely sportive
impulses of childhood, impulses which are in themselves
entirely innocent and wholesome. One of the
most valuable parts of a child’s training is the acquiring
of a set of notions as to appropriateness—the
knowledge of when he may, and when he may not,
rightly give rein to his wish to play. Some children
acquire these ideas of propriety readily, and adapt
themselves seemingly without effort to the customs of
their environment; but most children stumble through
the period of adaptation with many backslidings, for
the instinct of play is stronger than the instinct of
adaptation to requirement.</p>

<p class='c007'>But let it be remembered meanwhile that this same
play instinct is one of the strongest allies of the teacher
in securing such adaptation, if the instinct is properly
directed. What lesson of politeness, neatness, unselfishness,
protection of the weak, promptness, responsibility,
care of pets, coöperation, chivalry—yes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>even of duty and religion—may not be taught through
play! Draining off the play impulses into these legitimate
channels will relieve many a wearisome, perplexing
day for both teacher and pupils, and at the same
time speed on the child toward conscious self-control.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps the greatest single help in teaching children
the voluntary limitation of their play impulses, is the
knowledge that play is only postponed, not forbidden.
Most children have so strong a love of approbation
that they like to do things in the proper way if the
sacrifice be not too great. They are willing to put off
their fun, but not to put it off forever. The teacher
who says, “If you’ll wait until recess, I’ll show you
how to play a new game with marbles,” will secure
willing obedience, when she who takes the marbles
away has only sullen submission for her reward. Here
the teacher utilizes the instinctive love of novelty in
teaching control of play impulses. During the period,
when conduct is so largely a matter of instinct, wise
teachers play off one instinct against another to the
child’s gain, knowing that some impulses need encouragement
and others need to be inhibited.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>First Grade</div>

<p class='c007'>(1) “<i>Just mischief.</i>” One of the most frequent
ways in which the play instinct expresses itself in the
first and even in higher grades is in the little annoyances
which teachers group together under the general
term, mischief. An energetic child, if he is not constantly
employed, naturally vents his energy either in
play or in trying to satisfy his curiosity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principle of suggestion alone will often be sufficient
to control the child. The principle of substitution
will work equally well. Coöperation can be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>correlated with either of these, and expectation that
the child will do what the teacher desires should be
used in whatever method the teacher may adopt.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mischievous boy will be quiet so long as he is
reciting, but while others are reciting he will immediately
hunt for something else to do. He will drag his
shoe on the floor, reach over and touch his neighbor,
pull out a pocketful of string or help himself to his
neighbor’s pencil.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not a case for punishment, but a time to apply
one or more of the fundamental principles. The
teacher, without even a word or look, may reach over
and draw him to her side, asking him to look on her
book, or better still she may look on his book (suggesting
that he attend to his lesson). She may send him
on some little errand—to bring a book or a piece of
crayon—and by the time she whispers, “Thank you,
you did that like a little gentleman,” he will have
forgotten all about his mischief (substitution and
approval).</p>

<p class='c007'>When the class is dismissed, however, the teacher
must see that the mischievous boy is kept busy and his
work changed once or twice within the half hour. She
must not fail to show an interest in his work. The
comment, “That is so good, my boy, that I want you
to put it on my desk where we can look at it,” will so
elate the child that he will work industriously to do
his best, and doing his best will keep him busy a long
time. When on the playground or in the gymnasium
the teacher must see that he gets plenty of “full-of-fun”
play. It will use up some of his restless energy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The teacher must have an abundance of busy work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>ready for the next restless period that comes, sorting
blocks or marbles, straws or papers, cutting or coloring
pictures, putting books on the shelf, and anything
that will keep him innocently busy. Stencil cards,
cutting out words or letters, the distributing of materials
for the class to use, games for the recess and noon
periods, frequent story periods during school hours,
interesting lessons, vigorous exercise, generous approval
of every effort to please the teacher—all these
will gradually win the mischievous boy to habits of
self-control and industry. All children like stories,
and during the telling of the story, if it is at all worth
while, the children will be quiet and attentive. The
teacher may, however, call the restless child to herself,
saying to him, “I like to have somebody stand by
me.” Better still, she may gather all the pupils
around her and say to the mischievous boy, “Robert,
I am going to tell you a story. The other boys and girls
may listen.” This will captivate the child, and when
she has finished she may ask him to tell the story.</p>

<p class='c007'>By this time the reader will sigh and ask, “Must
all this be done to keep one mischievous boy at work?”
Yes, but it is far easier to interest him than to be worried
by his pranks. Then, too, by keeping him interested,
the teacher is administering to his development,
while to let him loll in his mischief would only tend to
create in him habits of inattention and idleness. At
the close of the day the boy will go home happy and
the benediction of a happy teacher will follow him.
Nothing adds more to a teacher’s usefulness and happiness
than the thought of work well done.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the above procedure the teacher has practiced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>suggestive control. She has led the mischievous boy
into activities that interest him, that appeal and fascinate
as well as satisfy that active mind, and that will
mature into right action. It is far easier to deal with
a child full of life, than to deal with a dullard. Direct
properly the impulse that causes this mischief, and it
will become a force for real good in the child’s life.
The discreet teacher will look ahead and avoid difficulties,
and nowhere will she get more valuable clues
to a method of control than on the playground.</p>

<p class='c007'>Watch the child in his play at recess to see what
activity interests him most. Suggest to him some
point about that activity which he has overlooked and
commend him on his skill. Every child has a hobby.
If you can find this boy’s hobby and tell him something
about it which he does not know, you will make a
warm place in his heart for yourself. Then utilize the
knowledge thus gained, and his increased confidence
in you, in order to add to his school work just the element
that will make it so interesting for the child that
he will find the work more delightfully fascinating
than the mischief.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first grade teacher needs to be in her room but
a few days before she will see some little child making
grimaces at his neighbor and not infrequently he may
make a grimace at the teacher, especially if he feels
that the teacher has not dealt fairly with him. This
is not a serious annoyance and should give the prudent
teacher no worry. It can not be repeated too often that
many of the small offenses that harass a school day
are doubly intensified by the attention that is paid
them. Often when a pupil does some petty misdemeanor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>he would soon forget it were it not that the
teacher notices it and pounces upon the offender with
some brand of punishment and thereby the child learns
that this certain offense is a thing that the teacher dislikes.
In the future, whenever that child’s feelings
are ruffled, he will resort to this certain offense to
annoy the teacher. The discreet teacher will train her
pupils in such a way that they will not settle upon
any specific type of annoyance.</p>

<p class='c007'>In cases where a child resorts to the practice too
frequently, the teacher will find it well to devise some
means by which she can substitute one activity for
another; that is, substitute a more interesting activity
for the making of grimaces. The teacher may use
the following method and conversation:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Children, we are planning to have a little play
party once a month. This is to be on the last Friday
afternoon of each month. Each one of you is to bring
either a cooky, an apple, an orange, or a banana, and
I will bring some candy. We will play all kinds of
games and just before school dismisses we will eat our
dainties. Won’t that be fine? But, children, I have
just thought that any one who makes grimaces or
ugly faces during the month ought not to be invited.
We do not want our party spoiled. What do you say?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course all, or nearly all of the children will say
that any one who is guilty of making faces shall not
come. The teacher who has not tried anything like
this will think it is absurd and impracticable, but it
will greatly assist in removing grimacing and many
other evils that troop through a teacher’s school experiences.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>The means of discipline need not necessarily be a
party. It can be some other affair or activity that
children like. If the teacher chooses a party, she must
have a goodly number of games ready and keep her
children intensely interested.</p>

<p class='c007'>The luncheon is an important feature of the party
and must be well managed by the teacher. All the
sweetmeats must be divided into small parts and so
mixed that a child does not get the dainty he contributed.
A cooky can be cut into four pieces, a banana
into four or five pieces, and the same with other sweetmeats.
Children like little things. Then, too, the
teacher may suggest that they play at having a
luncheon.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Making Faces For Fun</div>

<p class='c007'>Adams White knew a large number of systems by
which to rearrange his features so as to produce laughter.
When the book-agent sat at the side of the room,
Adams took occasion to entertain him with the horrible
figure made by drawing down his lower eyelids
until a large part of the eyeball was exposed to view.
The boy did this, or a similar prank, every once in a
while, and his teacher, young Benjamin Danner,
scarcely knew what penalty would do the boy the most
good.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unfortunately for Adams, he was caught in the act.
“Go to the blackboard, Adams. Put your hands behind
your back and lean forward till your head touches
the wall. Did you understand me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” thought the agent, “this is interesting. I
can hardly believe that such methods are in use today.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>But here is the proof right before my eyes.” He
watched Adams move in a clumsy, resistant manner,
and assume the position prescribed.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Instead of such a punishment as the one described
above, we propose that Mr. Danner pay no attention
to the deed until school is out for the day. Find some
favor that Adams can do for you and put him at it
immediately. When he has completed the task, or at
least made good headway, call him to one side, look
him straight in the eye, as he is seated in front of you,
and say:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Adams, you need to be careful how you look at visitors
who call at our school. The gentleman was surprised
at your action today. I felt sorry for him. I
want to know if you can keep at your work in an
orderly way on similar occasions hereafter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>If the answer is more or less satisfactory, accept it
and say:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Firm Injunction</div>

<p class='c007'>“I am going to depend on you for this. I want to
see no more expressions of shame on the face of a
visitor because of your conduct. I want every pupil
to work straight on no matter who may come in.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>This boy needs no publicity as a reward for his misdemeanor;
he will sooner or later take advantage of
his unexpected predicament to make more trouble for
his teacher. The penalty had no logical connection
with the prank, and only aggravated the boy’s antipathy
toward school rules. Mr. Danner advertised his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>lack of good discipline by resorting to this barbarous
penalty, especially when a stranger was present.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the conduct of Adams is to be permanently improved,
this one act must be viewed in its relation to
his conduct generally. As soon as Adams feels vitally
his part in making the school a success, his behavior
will improve. No pupil is so obstreperous that one
need despair of winning him by some kind of means,
at least until one has exhausted his resources.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plan recommended above, or some adaptation of
it, can be used profitably for a pupil of any grade.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Making a Man</div>

<p class='c007'>Jim was ten years old when he was transferred from
Webster Street School in the East End of the city to
Central School on Main Street. This transfer was
the culmination of a long series of misdemeanors on
his part and many untactful methods employed by his
teachers. No species of juvenile mischief remained
untried by him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He went into each room with a scarred record from
his former teacher, and was not allowed to forget the
fact that he always did the wrong thing. He was
scolded daily, sent into the hall to stay for hours and
gaze benignly upon the works of art that decorated
the walls, which of course he didn’t do, not being
deeply engrossed in art study. More naturally he
spent the time in mischievous pranks. He was whipped,
threatened, and denied the advantages of less energetic
and less talented pupils.</p>

<p class='c007'>But with the transfer came a change in the boy’s
nature. When he entered Central School, Miss Burns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>grasped his hand and said, “Well, Jim, I’m glad you’re
going to be in our school. I know we’re going to get
along finely.” She treated him as if he intended to do
the right thing, and before long he actually thought he
did so intend.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had him go on errands for her when she saw
he was getting restless, or erase the blackboard for her
after an exercise, which he did with great dispatch,
and before the end of the first day she had completely
won his respect and gratitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>One morning on his way to school Jim heard his
classmates planning Christmas presents for their
teacher. Immediately he began to contrive ways and
means for securing a beautiful necklace he had seen
in the jeweler’s shop—a necklace of gold and pearls.
This was the only gift that his active little brain could
conceive of as being worth giving to Miss Burns.</p>

<p class='c007'>Only, he hadn’t the money to buy the necklace. His
parents were far-seeing in a financial way, and did not
believe in bestowing unlimited amounts of coin upon
their children. So it was that Jim found need to do
something unusual in order to secure the coveted present.
He was not long in working up a paper route.
He would rise early in the morning and spend long
hours delivering his papers.</p>

<p class='c007'>In connection with this work he took orders for
Christmas wreaths, then secured a large quantity of
holly from a wholesale man on market; his little sister,
Ruth, bought a supply of fluffy, flaming ribbon at the
Ten-Cent Store. Together they made the wreaths,
Jim paying Ruth for her artistic advice and time. In
this way the wreaths cost less than the ready-made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>wreaths, and Jim was able to secure a better price
for them. Thus Jim saved enough money to buy the
necklace and also some lovely presents for those at
home.</p>

<p class='c007'>You can imagine Miss Burn’s surprise when, among
other gifts, she found Jim’s necklace on her desk the
morning before Christmas. Realizing the value of the
gift and Jim’s true devotion to her, she won from him
the story of his sacrifice. She said, “Oh, Jim, you
don’t know how this makes me feel,” and Jim went
home at the end of the day with a beaming face.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jim’s sacrifice reacted upon himself, for this taste
of his powers led him into many fair means of earning
money, and so launched him well on what turned out
to be a successful business career.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Making faces” is essentially a little child’s offense,
although sometimes it persists in upper grades or
even in the high school.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 85 (FOURTH GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>“Making Faces” for Spite</div>

<p class='c007'>In a small village there existed bad feeling between
the pastor of the church and several of his leading
members. Some parishioners took sides with the
pastor, and in the school the children of these two
church factions carried on the quarrel of their elders.
The teacher kept peace on the playground through
active personal supervision, but in school he encountered
the face-making problem in a degree only less
ridiculous than it was annoying.</p>

<p class='c007'>There existed an active emulation in the ugliness of
the facial contortions produced, and when a member
of one faction had made a particularly horrid grimace,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>he looked for and received the silent applause of his
sympathizers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Charles Briggs was the teacher. He knew that the
feeling of alliance in the members of the factions was
the cause of the face-making epidemic, but he could
not at first think of a logical way of meeting the situation.
He tried, first, the use of his absolute authority.
He forbade the making of faces, and punished the
children when he caught them at it. Whereupon
face-making became a more exciting sport than ever,
since the zest of escaping notice was added to the
pleasure of presenting an ugly front to the enemy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Briggs said, “How funny you would all look
if your faces should stay twisted into those grotesque
shapes.” Nevertheless the children spent their recesses,
when kept in, in inventing new twists and contortions;
they stood in corners and drew the attention
of the whole room to fresh triumphs in grotesqueness.
The evil grew, because the cause was not touched. One
boy even set a looking-glass up in front of his book,
into which he made faces for the benefit of the girl
who sat behind him, keeping his head lowered meanwhile
as if using his handkerchief to wipe his tearful
eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Mr. Briggs began to think of underlying
causes and intrinsic remedies. As a consequence, he
made up a fairy story about a land where people’s
thoughts molded their features with instant magic into
the semblance of ugly animals or noble men and beautiful
women. He introduced a princess of evil disposition
whose face was that of a cross, snapping dog,
but whom a magician changed into a being of loveliness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>and grace by his persuasions to self-sacrifice and
kindness. He told this story as vividly as he could,
with emphasis upon the dislike people feel for an ugly
face. Then he waited a day or two for the story to
take effect. He heard the children laughingly allude
to it once or twice, but the evil went on.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he talked to his school about face-making. He
explained that such contortions really do affect the
faces and characters of those who make them, not of
those who see them. He led his boys and girls to see
that face-making made them contemptible, and that
every time it was done it published the inferiority of
the doer. Then, having condemned the old ideal, he
tried to build up a new habit by showing that the
strongest man is the one who is most self-controlled,
and ended by a little skillful ridicule of the babyish
method they had been taking to show a silly spite.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Suppose,” he proposed at last, “that we put the
babies who make faces over here with the primary
pupils, where they’ll feel more at home? Bright people
don’t like to be associated with such children. But
we’ll not try it unless we have to. I shall watch you
during the next few days, and I’m going to see how
many can show their friends and their enemies, if they
have any, that they are worth respecting, and that
their souls don’t look like twisted turnips.”</p>

<p class='c007'>No magical change came over the school, but gradually
the sentiment for, and practice of, face-making
died out. The children unconsciously copied the
teacher’s contempt for it. By stories and references
he built up an ideal of beauty and dignity in personal
appearance and behavior.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Briggs did well to search for underlying causes
and effective remedies, because the use of authority
in such a case is a mistake, as he found. Make no
attempt to suppress the practice, but proceed at once
to the constructive plan of building up a good sentiment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whatever you do, do not assume that the pupil is
disrespectful to you. If the pupils have shown such
disrespect in the past, simply set about gaining their
confidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Face-making is largely an outgrowth of the play
impulse, no matter what its motive. Substitute a
better form of play. Dramatizing a story that emphasizes
the opposite of the undesirable characteristics,
is one of the best ways of overcoming the fault. Read
“The Little Knight of Kentucky” during the twenty-minute
periods just before school closes. Dramatize
parts of it. When the children are imbued with the
chivalrous spirit of the story, suggest the incongruities
of face-making and other spiteful acts, by saying to
the boy whom you “catch”: “Harold, the little knights
of Kentucky did not make faces at each other. Would
we be as proud of them as we are, had they done so?
Then, let’s not have any one who makes faces play that
story today.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>When the motive is the approbation of fellow-pupils,
these fellow-pupils must be made to change their attitude
of admiration for muscular grotesqueness for one
of appreciation of facial repose, beauty and dignity.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>It is a matter of inculcating ideals. Beautiful pictures
of ideal faces, such as those of Hoffman’s <cite>Boy Christ</cite>
and Raphael’s <cite>Madonna of the Chair</cite>, may be used to
illustrate the ideal of fine, controlled faces that express
beautiful and kind thoughts. Sometimes offhand
contempt of a babyish practice helps, especially
with a vain and self-conscious type of pupil.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cure for Bad Manners</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Grasome stood aghast at the rude manners
and selfishness of her third grade pupils. She had
tried many plans for improving the situation, but with
little success, for the children had the constant example
before them of rude manners in their homes. As the
Christmas season drew near she thought to herself,
“I’ll try once more. We will dramatize ‘The Birds’
Christmas Carol.’ Perhaps that beautiful story will
teach the children the lesson that I seem to have failed
thus far in clinching. I’ll use the rudest and most
selfish girl I have for the sick child’s part. She won’t
play as well as some of the others, but if she’ll only
catch the lesson I want her to get, I won’t mind the
blunders.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The proposition to have a play instead of a Christmas
tree delighted the children. The story interested
them so much that when, toward the latter part of
their study, Miss Grasome proposed that they follow
out the thought of the story and make some needy or
unfortunate person the recipient of their gifts this
year instead of making them to each other, the children
were quite ready for the sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course committees must be appointed, and much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>coöperative work done before all details could be arranged.
But every child had a share in the planning,
and not many weeks had passed before a gentler and
more considerate spirit began to dominate the school-room.
Miss Grasome smiled and said to herself: “Coöperation
works better than prohibiting or forcing,
even in such matters as the training of manners, it
seems.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Paper Wads</div>

<p class='c007'>Algie B. knew all the fun there is in throwing paper
wads, particularly when he could run the greatest
risks of detection and yet escape discovery. Said he
to himself one busy morning:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I believe I’ll take a shot at Redtop. The teacher’s
got him scared into looking at his book; he’s got to be
waked up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A good-sized wad soon sped across space, struck
Redtop plump on the side of the head, fell and rolled
back toward Algie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Better yet, I’ll just get that wad and have it for
another shot. It’s a lucky boy I am, if I can do that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Stooping, he made four stealthy steps forward, regained
his wad and slid back into his seat. When Miss
Stone looked about, the next moment Algie’s eyes fell
to his book and all was quiet and peaceful as a day
in spring.</p>

<p class='c007'>This fine example of bravery and success was not
lost on other restless spirits. By the next day an
observing onlooker counted up ten instances in which

<p class='c007'>On the third day over-boldness brought the climax.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>Miss Stone had been too much absorbed to note the
minor noises that were provoked. But when Amy
Lane, nervous, uncontrolled, uttered a yell of terror
as a cold wad struck her in the back of her neck and
slipped down, ten pupils broke loose in a chorus of
laughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Stone roused up and, strange to say, succeeded
in getting a story of the recent happenings. She
threatened the last culprit, who in self-defense said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why must I suffer when all the other boys do the
same thing?” and he named nearly every boy in school,
ending up with Algie.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her threats of punishment of course were vain in
the presence of so many offenders. With a sharp talk
she dropped the discussion.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>School-room behavior will never take care of itself
under any system of management. A teacher who
thinks he has solved all of his disciplinary problems
is resting in a deceitful security. A sweet trustfulness
that keeps every pupil in his most delightful mood and
never sees the wild emotions and boisterous conduct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>that arises from them is the rock of destruction for a
teacher’s influence.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (SIXTH GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Painting Face</div>

<p class='c007'>Roland was an unkempt, dirty, red-headed little
fellow in the sixth grade of a small town school. He
came from an unlettered, hard-working, shiftless family
in the country and, like Topsy, had just growed up.
He was bright enough, but his reasoning power and
sense of right and wrong were undeveloped because he
had never been taught rightly. He had been whipped
when naughty without fully understanding that what
he had done was wrong.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day, in the new school, he daubed his nose,
cheeks and chin with ink when Miss Downer, the
teacher, was not looking, and convulsed with laughter
everyone who looked at him.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was almost recess time, and Miss Downer quietly
bade him wash his face. When the rest were dismissed
she said, “Roland, I want to speak to you a minute.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Going to get a licking!” whispered the boy behind
him, and Roland grinned scornfully, for whippings
really did not matter much to him any more, though
Miss Downer was new and untried and she looked as
though she might be pretty strong.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the rest had gone Miss Downer sat down in
front of Roland and spoke to him kindly, “Roland, why
do you do such things in school?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Roland shifted uneasily and said, “Dunno.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Have you your language lesson?” at which he
shook his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Didn’t you think that besides foolishly wasting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>your own time you were wasting the other children’s
time by making them laugh at you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was an entirely new thought to him and he
looked at her in incomprehension.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You come to school to learn, don’t you, Roland?
And the more you can learn the better off you will be.
Some day when you get to be a man you’ll be glad you
know more than somebody else, and sorry that you
don’t know as much as some other person. Why, you
were just telling me yesterday that your father didn’t
have a chance to go to school beyond the fourth grade!
And here you are wasting this precious, precious time
of yours!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Roland looked intently at a dirty finger-nail and Miss
Downer could not tell whether she had made an impression
on him or not. She gave him a story from a
supplementary reader, telling of Lincoln’s struggles
to get an education, to read during the rest of recess.</p>

<p class='c007'>A week later Roland became really interested in the
history lesson. This teacher’s questions weren’t the
kind you could answer, parrot-like, by memorizing the
words of the textbook. You had to stop and think
about it. He asked, “I’d like to know about this yere
Civil War, anyway. Some says they fit about slavery
and the book says because they seceded, and I’d like to
know which is right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Downer devoted the rest of the class period to
satisfying Roland’s query, and counted the time well
spent because she had laid the first stone in the foundation
of Roland’s education—she had aroused intellectual
curiosity, satisfied it, and given him food for more
questions.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>Every time he misbehaved after that she kept him
in and talked to him seriously. Not once did she
threaten or scold. And at other times she tried to
draw him out by being interested in him and his affairs—the
baby brother at home, a new dog he had, and
what “my paw” said and did.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length Roland began to realize that this teacher
was not a vindictive creature, wreaking her spite upon
him for harmlessly amusing himself and other people,
but one who was interested in him, Roland Smith, and
really cared what he did and thought. And, though
she had queer ways of looking at things, he really hated
to disappoint her and she could make him feel most
awfully uncomfortable and ashamed of himself.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Paper Wads</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Downer’s final test came when Roland was discovered
throwing paper wads at a boy across the room.
Miss Downer felt very much inclined to thrash him
soundly, for this was a case of wanton naughtiness.
But she did not.</p>

<p class='c007'>Instead she merely talked to him as she had talked
before, bringing in a little more of the personal
element.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Roland, what if your brother kicked you every
time you were almost asleep at night, or joggled your
elbow every time you started to take a mouthful at the
table, or pulled the chair out from under you when
you started to sit down? It would be funny at first,
wouldn’t it, but how long do you suppose you and
your brother could keep on playing together as good
friends if he kept it up?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Roland shook his head, mystified.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s just what you’re doing to me. You told me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>you wanted to learn and get on in the world, and the
rest of these children do, too—they don’t want to be
stupid when they’re grown up. But we can’t learn
very fast with some one hindering us all the time, and
I was counting on your help.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Downer spoke very kindly and earnestly, and
looked directly at Roland.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wasn’t goin’ to throw them paper wads, honest
I wasn’t, Miss Downer. But before I knowed it, they
was thrown,” and Roland did look truly sorry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Downer’s impulse was to punish him, not to
forgive him again, but if he really were sorry and trying
to do better, a whipping would spoil all the good
work she had accomplished so far.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you sorry, Roland?” her voice was low and
serious.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a long pause, during which Roland fingered
a scrap of paper nervously, not looking up. Then
his lip began to quiver and he nodded violently, breaking
into sobs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I—I d-didn’t mean to and I won’t do it no more,
honest.” Roland, whose boast was that “nary whipping”
had ever made him cry, was penitent because
he had disappointed her who had been kind to him.</p>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Laughing at Nothing</div>

<p class='c007'>Hen. Rutgers couldn’t help having plenty of fun.
If no one made it for him he took a turn and produced
it himself. He could have plenty and not laugh. Then
he could laugh like the falling water on a cataract when
there was very little fun in sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hen. laughed. He laughed out loud. Miss Gresham
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>went speedily to his desk, looked him straight in the
face, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Henry, why did you laugh just now?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hen. lifted his head slowly and just as slowly rolled
his eyes over until he looked her squarely in the eyes.
With their glances mutually fixed Henry said very
deliberately:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I—don’t—know,” without a smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Henry, you surely know what caused you to laugh.
What was it?” Then glibly but without a smile came
Henry’s reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“O yes, I remember. I was just thinking what
would happen if Mr. Finley (superintendent, weighing
two hundred and fifty pounds) should back off the
platform there sometime when he’s walking around so
fast.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You should be at work, Henry,” was all that Miss
Gresham could utter at the time. The chief reason
for her weak response was she had drawn the attention
of half the pupils and a general titter arose at Henry’s
reply chiefly because of his absolute composure of
countenance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Henry did not care so much for mischief for its own
sake. His chief sport was attracting the attention of
other pupils and getting the teacher into a mild predicament
by setting a sort of disciplinary trap for her.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Avoid asking such questions as, What made you
laugh? Why did you do it? etc., except privately.
Even then unless you are reasonably sure of a satisfactory
answer to these questions you may complicate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>your case by so doing instead of helping it toward a
solution.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pass over details of causes which pupils most often
allude to and lay hold of the prime provocation for bad
order. Use your power of analysis and apply an effective
remedy. Henry needs an abundance of heavy but
interesting work. Bear down so deep into his interest
in geology that he cannot menace your loyalty to him
by trifling with you in respect to discipline. Treat him
so squarely, frankly, generously that his respect for
you will be an unremitting check on small misdemeanors.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Pupils may not know what to answer when asked,
“Why did you do so and so?” The truth is the causes
are numerous. The last cause may have been the
stumbling of one pupil over another one’s foot. But
another cause lies behind this—disrespect for the
teacher; behind this, fondness for another teacher.
Why does a pupil act in a certain fashion? He is
underfed, improperly clothed, irritated from insufficient
sleep—these are all proper answers to the question,
“Why?” Hence, every time the query is put a
teacher runs the risk of provoking a worse situation
and yet of gaining nothing from the inquisition.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION</h4>

<p class='c016'>Superintendent Finley called Henry in after his little
one-act play in the assembly room and the following
interview occurred.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Gymnasium</div>

<p class='c007'>“I have some facts about your affairs in the study
<span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>period, Henry, that need to be cleared up. Yesterday
you are said to have denied making faces when the
fact was you had been guilty.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Remedy</div>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I’ll tell you just how it was. I was at my
desk. Miss Gresham thought something was off-color
and came down to see me. I told her I didn’t know
and then I recalled and answered her. The pupils
looked on and laughed. Miss Gresham was nettled, I
suppose. She walked down the aisle, stopped at Ellen’s
desk, her back to me, and said to Ellen,</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Look over to Henry’s desk and see what he is
doing.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ellen caught sight of me and must have told that
I was making a face, for Miss Gresham came to me and
said: ‘What were you doing just now?’ I said, ‘Nothing.’
She said, ‘You were making a face.’ I said, ‘I
was not.’ Then she sent me home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why did you deny making a face?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because I hadn’t done it. I scowled but that was
all. I didn’t do anything that need excite Miss
Gresham. She’s got it in for me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now that will do on that. You are not properly occupied
some way in your periods in the study room. I
credit you with having intellect enough to know how
to play the gentleman. It’s a question of whether you
are always going to take advantage of opportunities
to make sport at the expense of pupils’ and teachers’
time, or whether you are going to help make school
work a success. I know pretty well what you think
on these matters, but I’d like to hear you express yourself
on this point.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Henry did discuss the matter; there were a few weak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>spots in his view of school life. His evident restlessness
during long school hours was a predisposing cause
of several troubles. For this and other reasons, Mr.
Finley decided to revise his schedule for use of the
gymnasium during school hours and to provide suitable
interruptions of mental labor by physical exercise
of various sorts. This new program gratified the
pupils as well as relieved physical necessities.</p>

<p class='c007'>The interview ended fortunately for both teacher
and pupil and eventually brought relief to several
unfavorable conditions in the school as a whole.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) <i>Teasing tricks.</i> Sometimes a pupil can cause
no end of annoyance by teasing others. This fault
may have been trained into the child at home.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 88 (SEVENTH GRADE)</h4>

<p class='c016'>A bright lad and into all sorts of mischief, George
had gradually acquired the reputation among the
teachers of being “a bad boy”; and the new superintendent
was informed to this effect when he came to
the school.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Snake in School-room</div>

<p class='c007'>One day there was a great commotion in his grade;
an innocent garter snake had been let loose in the
school-room. George was accused, and as the disturbance
had begun in his corner of the room, and as he
was known to have a great fondness for all sorts of
animals, insects, snakes, etc., the evidence seemed
decidedly against him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir!” he replied to the superintendent, when
sent for to go to the office. “No, sir! I didn’t do it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m afraid that you are not telling me the truth,
George. You have a bad reputation. I think that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>shall punish you by sending you into the next lower
grade, until you can learn to become more of a man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s such a disgrace, mother! No, I can’t go back.
The boys will all make fun of me. Besides, I didn’t
do it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, however, his mother made him see that the
manly thing would be to take his punishment, even if
he wasn’t to blame. So, on the following morning,
he reported himself to the teacher of the next lower
grade, and told her that he was to study there.</p>

<p class='c007'>Later in the day the superintendent made his rounds,
and exclaimed surprisedly, when he saw George,</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, you here? I didn’t expect to ever see you
again!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Needless to say that was the last appearance of
George at school, and a life that might have been
helped was spoiled by an unjust punishment and a
careless remark. Even superintendents may make
mistakes!</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Say to the mischief-loving boy, “George, we can
not have these animals loose in the school-room; it disturbs
our work entirely too much. But there is a way
that we can have them here, some of them at least, and
everybody enjoy them. How would you like to help me
make a fresh water aquarium for the school?” “You
would like it? Very well. We shall need one more
to help us. Tell the boy who brought in the snake to
come to me with you this afternoon and together we
will plan how to make the aquarium. We’ll get it all
ready and give the other children a surprise. I’ll help
<span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>you until it is ready for the animals. You and he can
get the specimens, and after that I would like to have
you two take care of them. Meanwhile, we’ll get from
the library all the books we can find about the animals
you two select, and talk about them in the nature study
period.” The aquarium, referred to above, need not
be an expensive apparatus. In fact, most any kind of
a vessel or a very large bottle would serve the purpose
very well. Do not furnish this yourself but let one of
the boys bring it.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>The fact that George was fond of animals, insects,
snakes, etc., was the clew for the teacher to work upon
in gaining the good will and coöperation of the troublesome
boy. Knowing one strong interest that he had,
the teacher should start with that and work out from
it to other and broader fields of action.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unless the teacher had actual proof to the contrary,
she should have accepted the boy’s statement that he
did not bring in the snake. It is far better that a guilty
boy go unpunished, than that an innocent person be
punished. Take the initiative in coöperation with the
troublesome pupil and the troubles will soon disappear.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Pet Dog</div>

<p class='c007'>Henry Gould was very fond of his collie and insisted
upon having his company every day at school. His
teacher, Miss Greenway, probably would have made
no objection to this had it not been for a fact that the
dog was inclined to snap at any child except his master
and thus endanger the safety of the other children.
How to forbid the presence of the dog without arousing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>the antagonism of his owner was the problem. She
resolved to try approval and initiative in coöperation.
So she called Henry to her at noon time and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Henry, I noticed the collie snapping at one of the
little girls today, and I think we shall have to ask him
to stay at home after this. But he is such a bright little
fellow we shall miss him. Don’t you think it would be
fine for the children to take his picture before he goes?
How would you like to get him into a good position
when the drawing period comes and let the children
use him for a model?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Henry was proud to have his pet honored, stood
by him patiently while the children drew, and made no
further insistence that he should come to school.</p>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>A Live Mouse</div>

<p class='c007'>A practical joke loses all of its point when nobody
is annoyed or made ridiculous by it. A teacher who
tactfully makes himself seem one of a group who is
deriving benefit from an experiment, wins the respect
of his students. Such a teacher was the high school
instructor in science, whose attention was directed to
a mischievous pupil, by a girl’s seemingly nervous fear
of this fun-loving boy. Cautious investigation revealed
the fact that a living mouse was in the wide-mouthed
bottle which protruded from the joker’s pocket.</p>

<p class='c007'>This principal told the boy that it would be instructive
fun to let the mouse loose in the building and see
what the timid little thing would do, but that such a
course of action would endanger the future safety of
books, lunches, etc., left in the building. He, therefore,
advised that, at the coming recess, all who did not fear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>the mouse, form a large circle in the school yard and
that the mouse be let loose in the center of the circle.
And that all observe closely just what the little animal
did.</p>

<p class='c007'>At recess, the principal himself joined the circle,
asking the boys to notice carefully whether or not the
mouse would change his course to avoid a shouting
student.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the mouse was experimented upon and killed
the mischief-maker began to wonder why it was that
he was glad that he had not annoyed the principal
with the mouse, as he had intended to do.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>This was the couplet that greeted John Fraser as he
entered his eighth grade room one September noon.
Above the couplet was a portrait of himself, the style
of his hair indicated very clearly. He erased the decorations
hastily, but said nothing about it. He was
very young, however, and the thoughtless disrespect
shown him hurt sadly.</p>

<p class='c007'>A day or two passed, during which he noticed the
covert amusement at his faultlessly pressed clothes, his
punctilious manners, his careful grooming, all new and
strange to the crude little town in the Southwest in
which he taught. Then, one noon, he entered the room
from the playground to find a rough cartoon on the
board, labeled, “Mr. Fraser pressing his pants to make
creases at 2 a.m.” The pupils were vastly entertained
by it.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>“Who made this picture?” John demanded, very
angry and feeling that his dignity demanded that the
offender be punished. Every head turned instantly
toward Cleaver Trotter, who seemed much pleased to
be singled out for attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cleaver, you may remain in at recess. I want to
see you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just as you say, Mr. Fraser!” sang out Cleaver,
jauntily. There was a half-suppressed titter of admiration,
and Mr. Fraser felt that he had come out second
best.</p>

<p class='c007'>At recess he ascertained that Cleaver had really
drawn the picture, and forbade him sternly to repeat
the offense. The interview took place in the otherwise
empty school-room, and when Cleaver was allowed to
go he joined a group of gaping admirers on the playground.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What did he do to you?” they demanded to a man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, he asked me why I did it, and I told him I
couldn’t help it; I just knew it took him all night to
press his pants that way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what did he say then?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, he smelled of the smelling-salts and said
that’d be all for today, so I came on out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>None of this account was true, but Cleaver won by it
the thing his boyish vanity wanted, the admiration of
his crowd. They approved the ridicule because it furnished
them with fun, and Cleaver was shrewd enough
to know that his leadership depended upon their approbation
of his attitude. He annoyed John Fraser constantly
throughout the school year, not because he disliked
him or wanted to be troublesome, but because the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>teacher could not perceive that Cleaver had a mania for
approbation which needed to be guided into better
channels.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>The pupil who does evil for approbation will do
good for the same cause, if approbation for good can
be secured. In this case, Mr. Fraser might have turned
Cleaver’s talent for making cartoons and doggerel into
less personal use, utilizing the admiration of his classmates
as a spur to accomplishment. If he had asked
Cleaver, for instance, to illustrate some event in current
history with an original cartoon, to accompany a
talk to be given in opening exercises, even Cleaver’s
vanity would have been satisfied at the flattery of having
his talent taken so seriously. At the same time the
narrow personal nature of Cleaver’s interests would
have been broadened by a knowledge of affairs outside
his immediate world.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Wise teachers do not allow the rudeness, crudeness
and childishness of their pupils to disturb their
serenity. They know that good manners and consideration
are the result of training, and with “a fine
disregard of personalities” they set about giving this
training. The great art in such cases is to substitute
a good activity for the bad one which has heretofore
gained the approbation sought.</p>

stormed. “Today he said to me, ‘Say, Miss Costello,
do you wear a hat in winter?’ and I said of course I
did, and why shouldn’t I? And he said he should
think it would have to be lined with asbestos. Then
they all bellowed, and if he ever mentions it again I’ll
lambast him for it,” and Mary’s eyes snapped with
indignation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There now, Mary, don’t be after letting a fool kid
upset ye so,” her wise old mother advised. “That Thad
Burrows is a bright boy, and if it was someone else’s
thatch he said it about ye’d be laughing with him altogether.
I’ll bet that if you’ll win the heart of him,
he’ll lick anyone that dares to think of a white horse
when you’re around.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mary pondered this advise and took it. She showed
no resentment toward Thaddeus, but rather sought
ways of being especially kind to him. She discovered
that he was eager to earn money, and helped him find
work in town on Saturdays; she lent him books and
deferred to his opinion in matters of stove-tending and
mouse-catching. He came to connect his leadership
with the teacher, who found so many little ways of
giving him the prominence his soul craved. The red
hair ceased to be a joke, and by the term’s end the
prophecy of Mary’s mother had come to pass.</p>

<p class='c016'>Raymond Smith had just taken up boxing. He was
accustomed to hang around a gang of street idlers and
would-be sports and when any of the number ventured
to put on the gloves he was fully alive to every move
they made.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not having funds to purchase a pair of gloves he
began pummelling smaller boys, getting some little

<div class='sidenote'>Shaking Fist</div>

<p class='c007'>Ellen Moore, teacher, knew boy nature fairly well.
She was strict in conduct but rarely was caught firing
her guns at a mere decoy. Raymond broke over bounds

desk one afternoon, he doubled up his fist and shoved
it in her direction—an excellent opportunity for rigid

<p class='c007'>“My, what a large, solid fist you have,” she said in
a quiet voice, quickly moving on to her next duty.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hand fell. The boy had no clear motive and yet

<p class='c007'>(3) <i>Practical jokes—a more serious kind of teasing.</i>
Imogene and Charles Rogers were two orphans,
living with elderly relatives who wanted to bring
them up wisely, but did not know how. They were
full to overflowing of animal spirits, bubbling with
fun, restlessly eager to fill every moment with good
times. Miss Spires, their teacher, was somewhat short-sighted,
and that is why, when a little mechanical
mouse ran from the second row of chairs right up
to her feet, she thought it a live one and jumped and
screamed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Imogene and Charles, who had bought the mouse at
the ten-cent store, were delighted past all bounds, and
all the children laughed. Miss Spires thought she had
been insulted, and without much ceremony put the two
children behind the piano. They were not at all resentful,
for here they had a good chance to plan more mischief,
and made a conspiracy to secure a repetition of
the entertaining panic of the morning by putting two
of their pet rabbits into Miss Spires’ desk at noon.
This great joke worked as well as the first—even
better. Miss Spires sent the “dreadful children”
to the principal for correction, with a message
which made the principal look at the young scapegraces
gravely. But she was a wise principal. She
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“What did Miss Spires do when you made the mouse
run up to her feet?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She just screeched!” gurgled Imogene in reminiscent
delight.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>“She jumped as high as my head!” Charles had a
good imagination.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did she screech when you put the rabbits into her
desk?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She hopped all around like a chicken, and asked
who did that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What did you say?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I said we did, and she didn’t think it a good joke,
but she said we were bad children and sent us to you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you think you are bad? What is it, to be bad?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Swearing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Biffing people that ain’t as big as you are.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And telling lies. That’s ’specially bad.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, that’s all true. But do you know, good things
are sometimes bad, when they are put in the wrong
places, and done at the wrong times.” The principal
had a long talk with the children, in which she discovered
that their attitude toward control was very good,
but that their ideas of appropriateness were very primitive.
This was because their elders had tried to repress
them instead of guiding them, and being made
of irrepressible stuff they had simply overrun boundaries.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why don’t you try to guide those play instincts
that are so strong in Imogene and Charles?” she asked
Miss Spires later. Miss Spires’ reply shows just why
she failed as a teacher:</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s not my business to study their ‘instincts.’
I’m here to teach them to read and write and cipher.”</p>

But he hasn’t very good manners to interrupt us so

the act was rude.)</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>A teacher who is so infantile as to scream at a tiny,
frightened mouse, even though it were a live one,
should not blame the pupils for indulging in less
marked exhibitions of arrest of development.</p>

<p class='c007'>Teachers meet pupils sanely on the play question
when they sympathize with their desire to play, but
see clearly why and how these impulses must be controlled
for the child’s future good. Play is a good
servant but a poor master; no human being is more
pitiful than the amusement drunkard. Play in its
right place is a wonderful renovator of health and
spirits; play in the wrong place stunts character and
makes for selfishness and littleness. The ideal teacher
wants his pupils to play, helps them to realize the great
values that lie in play, but shows them clearly that
play must be indulged in at right times and places, and
rigidly excluded from work hours, except where it can
be made to help on the work. In short, he leads his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>pupils as they grow older to play with reason and to
plan play intelligently, rather than blindly to follow
impulses.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Play in Study Hour</div>

<p class='c007'>In a certain large high school the teachers had had
much trouble with the students in the assembly room.
A spirit of uncontrolled play seemed to take possession
of the room a few minutes after the hour had begun.
Instead of settling down to work, the boys and girls
wrote notes, played little tricks on each other, whispered
and made endless meaningless trips to dictionary
and bookcase. They seemed to think the hour was
given to them for social purposes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many teachers had failed to remedy this condition,
before Miss Stansbury was relieved of two classes that
she might take hold of the assembly room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you give me permission to do whatever I think
is wise?” she asked the harassed principal.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go ahead,” said he. So she did.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had been in the room about five minutes, and
was busily marking papers, when a hard lemon came
rolling up the aisle toward her desk. She went to it,
picked it up, and saw that two boys, the only two who
could have thrown it up that aisle, were looking at her
under lowered lids. Very quietly, so as not to be overheard
except by those hard by, she asked who had
thrown the lemon, and the doer acknowledged at once—lying
was not a fault in this school.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You don’t seem to know what a study period is
for. You may take your books and go home, and
study your lessons there. I shall call up your mother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span>on the telephone and tell her why you are coming
home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I have a class this next hour, and I live clear
across the city!” exclaimed the student, in dismay.
“I can’t go home!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you can’t stay here, since you don’t know how
to use a common study hall. Please go at once, and
I’ll report to your teacher why you are gone. I have
work to do, and can’t spend my time policing the
room.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The puzzled boy rose slowly and left the room. Miss
Stansbury went to the high school office, called up his
mother, and told her that her son would be home
shortly, as he had been playing in the assembly room
and would therefore have to do his studying at home
that day.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But he can’t study at home. We live a mile and a
half across the city. What was he doing? Was it
anything dreadful?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not at all. He merely rolled a lemon up the aisle,
a very innocent performance at any other time—but
this happened to be study hour.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you may be very sure he won’t do it again!”
and the indignant mother hung up her receiver with
a snap.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Miss Stansbury reached the assembly room
again she saw a group standing around a boy near the
center of the room. They were giggling and peering
over his shoulder at something on the desk—which,
when she reached them, Miss Stansbury discovered to
be the last copy of <cite>Life</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t go to your seats yet. I want to talk to you a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_515'>515</span>moment, and I don’t want to disturb those who are
studying by talking very loud. You six people also
seem not to have learned what a study hour is for.
Play and fun and <cite>Life</cite> belong to other times and places.
I shall write your names on slips, and send them to the
teachers of your various classes, so that if you are
absent or tardy they may know why. And now you six
may take whatever study books you need and go home.
You can not stay here unless you study, for this is a
study period. I shall call up your homes and tell your
parents why you are coming home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you give us an excuse for absence from physics
next hour?” one boy asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, no. You have excuses only for necessary
absences.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But then we’ll get a zero for the recitation!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I suppose so. But a high school boy is supposed
to know enough to study during study hours.”
Miss Stansbury was smiling and implacable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The six passed out, grumbling and almost rebellious.
Miss Stansbury went again to the telephone, and told
five mothers (the sixth one being out) why their children
were coming home.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why don’t you <i>make</i> him study?” said one mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am doing so,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>When she returned to the assembly room all was
quiet. Not one of the students who were left cared to
play, or write notes, or roll lemons. Here was a teacher
who meant business. Miss Stansbury did not reform
the students altogether, for they often slid back into
their old habits when the younger and weaker teachers
had charge of the room. But when she was in charge,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_516'>516</span>there was quiet and industry, and no attempt at ill-timed
fun.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the time they have reached the high school,
pupils know what is expected of them during school
hours in a general way; but they also know that
teachers vary greatly in their standards. Some tolerate
play during work time, some do not. Those
who will tolerate it usually have to. Miss Stansbury
simply and quietly defined her stand, which was one
of absolute adherence to a work-while-you-work program.
Neither did she fall into the error of a certain
high school teacher who dallied around a note writer,
neither asking what he was doing nor demanding that
he work. She reasoned that if a study period is for
study, there is no sense in having it spoiled by interpolated
fun. She did not scold, she did not lecture,
she did not entreat, she did not moralize; she just
eliminated the disturbers, and after two examples of
her method everyone understood her and did as she
demanded. She assumed differentiation between working
and play hours. If she had used this method with
untrained, little children in the lower grades it would
have been a stupid and harmful mistake, for such children
have not yet learned to control their play impulses.
High school students know how; they will do
it if held up to a standard of action.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 91 (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<p class='c016'>The sophomore class in a high school decided to do
something to call public attention to the valor and
general high qualities to be found in its members. As
students their record was good. As to conduct no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_517'>517</span>member had suffered any extreme penalties, although
the superintendent’s son had often skirted the boundaries
of the unendurable.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Buildings Disfigured</div>

<p class='c007'>The class played the following pranks: during the
night the school bell was rendered useless by removal
of the rope and clapper; a donkey was taken up the
steps into the assembly room and left there until morning;
class emblems were painted in class colors in a
score of forbidden places.</p>

<p class='c007'>This second offense aroused the ire of the superintendent.
In a few days the class was called to meet
him and another member of the faculty. Mr. Webster,
the superintendent, at once asked the following questions:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would like to know what members of this class
took part in the disfigurement of the buildings and
grounds.” His manner was not offensive, yet his
firmness was very evident and a degree of anxiety was
betrayed in his voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>No answer was given. The superintendent then
questioned each member of the class as follows: “Were
you on the school grounds the night of the 14th? Did
you assist in disfiguring the property? Do you know
who did the work?” All but two members of the
class declared they were under obligations not to give
any answers that would reveal who was guilty; the
two others answered these questions truthfully; but
as they knew no pertinent facts about the incident,
nothing was gained.</p>

<p class='c007'>The superintendent’s next step was to say: “Do you
know any reason why the members of this class, except
these two, should not be suspended until the desired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_518'>518</span>information is given?” A few protests were heard,
but they all affirmed the right of a pupil to maintain
silence when asked to incriminate a fellow pupil. The
superintendent then announced the suspension to take
effect at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the end of two weeks a compromise was brought
about and a majority of the class returned to school.
The rebellious members had declared they would not
open negotiations with the superintendent. He had
declared that they must inform him who were guilty
of the offenses. Both of these demands were laid
aside. The superintendent was known to have changed
his decision and the offenders were publicly taunted
with backing down on the boast.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of these boys never re-entered the school;
others found their places soon, in another high school.
The memory of the incident is a sad one for all
concerned.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Release the donkey from his “embarrassing situation,”
but leave other details of the mischief for a day
or two. Some inkling of who the perpetrators are
will probably leak out in that time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile, have the damages appraised by the
school board.</p>

<p class='c007'>Next have a private talk with the president and
other officers of the class, stating to them the amount
of the damages, the fact that you will present the bill
to the class and that you will then turn it over to them
for collection; also that you will expect their hearty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_519'>519</span>coöperation in seeing that all damages are repaired
and paid for.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, address the class as a whole. Say to the
class, “I appreciate the funny side of your pranks
the other evening, but there are some damages that
some one has to pay. Two or three members of the
board, in whom all of us have confidence, have appraised
them at ten dollars. You have made a good
record as a class. I shall expect you to live up to your
reputation by doing the fair and square thing in this
instance also. That means that you will authorize
your president or some other member of the class to see
that damages are repaired and expenses paid. You
had lots of fun, but if the fun is ‘worth the candle,’
why, now, the only manly course to pursue is to ‘pay
for the candle.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think it will not be necessary for me to speak
of this episode again. I leave the matter in your
hands. I will ask your class president to report to me
when the work is completed.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>The superintendent lost ground with the school in
assuming a belligerent attitude, in trying to force a
confession, and in punishing innocent pupils because
they were unwilling to incriminate their classmates.
The weakness of his position is shown in the fact that
in the end he was obliged to compromise.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Carbon Bisulphide</div>

<p class='c007'>The room was full of pupils. A representative of
one of the numerous book companies was present.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_520'>520</span>Everything was moving smoothly and in order, when
suddenly the room began to fill with the disagreeable
odor of carbon bisulphide. It grew worse and worse.
Pupils were holding their noses to keep out the smell,
and some were covering their mouths to keep in the
laughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The situation was trying for the teacher. He was
embarrassed by the presence of the visitor, under such
odoriferous circumstances. What was to be done? It
would be useless to hold a public inquiry. It was a
time both for thought and tact. Finally the teacher
evolved his plan.</p>

<p class='c007'>Going on with the work, just as if nothing had happened,
the teacher conducted the remaining recitations
of the day, as usual. Meantime he kept his eyes open.
The odor gradually grew less offensive and most of
the pupils quietly resumed their customary work.</p>

<p class='c007'>The vigilance of the schoolmaster was finally rewarded.
One of the boys seemed to be enjoying the
situation to a greater degree than the rest. He was
unable to entirely conceal his enjoyment and this was
the teacher’s clue. He kept his eye innocently on this
boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just as school was about to close for the day, the
teacher said: “Frank, I’d like to see you a few moments
after dismissal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frank remained. His countenance paled slightly
and he no longer had difficulty in suppressing his
enjoyment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Frank,” began the principal, “where did that
preparation that made such a disagreeable odor here
this afternoon come from?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_521'>521</span>Frank looked guilty.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t have it here in the room,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Frank, but that’s not answering my question,”
responded the inquisitor severely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I had some bisulphide down on the playground,
but I didn’t bring it into the school-room,”
Frank finally admitted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What did you do with it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I gave it to Harry.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What did he do with it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well, you are excused for the present, till we
can see Harry.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The next night Frank and Harry were both asked
to remain. The superintendent was present. Two
pale boys appeared before the teachers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Harry, what did you do with the bottle of bisulphide
you got from Frank yesterday?” inquired the
superintendent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I kept it down on the playground awhile and then
threw it here in the wastebasket,” was Harry’s candid
response.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Didn’t you know what was in the bottle?” resumed
the teacher.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir, I didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Didn’t Frank tell you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir, he didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is that right, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I guess that’s right,” said Frank seriously.</p>

<p class='c007'>Evidently Harry was innocent for the most part.
After sound admonition by the superintendent the
boys were dismissed. Frank was very careful thereafter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_522'>522</span>and Harry was always an exemplary pupil. No
further disturbances of this nature occurred during
the year.</p>

game opens; explain the chief points in the rules.
Show what comes of neglecting the rules—confusion
and several other bad things. Prove that just as much
pleasure can be had by following some sort of system
as if one goes at play in a helter-skelter fashion.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>All children must be taught how to play despite the
fact that they have an insatiable appetite to engage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_524'>524</span>in it. Scattering hints will often suffice and save not
only injuries but open infractions of school regulations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Self-control is acquired only gradually, hence the
orderly play that is so delightful for pupils in the
teens is preceded by a period of learning.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most first grade children are afraid to snowball, but
in the second grade boys begin to want to do brave
things and in consequence can do some damage by
snowballing. Snowballing should not be considered an
offense. Every teacher knows how he has enjoyed
the sport. It is only the carelessness that may creep
into the play that may cause a window to be broken
or some child to be hurt in the eyes, ears, or about
the face or body. It is really necessary that a teacher
should teach the pupils how to snowball, when there
is snow on the ground. She should go with them and
enjoy the sport.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Limitations in Play</div>

<p class='c007'>“One, two, three,” and all the boys and girls passed
out of the room, Miss O’Gorman following. “Remember
now, Phil, no hard snowballs, as I told you in the
school-room.” “Now wait until we get out of reach of
the windows before you begin.” “Are we divided
up evenly, just the same number on both sides? Let’s
count and see. Yes, just fifteen on each side.” “Now,
ready, everybody.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss O’Gorman let her ball fly along with the others,
as she was to play a few minutes on each side. She
kept a keen eye for illegal conduct and spurred all of
them on in the fine fun.</p>

<p class='c007'>This had been prearranged with parents’ consent to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_525'>525</span>occur just at the close of school so that the children
could go home and dry up their clothes at once if it
became necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the end of twenty minutes one side gave away
and yielded the honors to the others and the game
ended. On her way home Miss O’Gorman remarked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I like to have the snow come because then I can
snowball, but children, I never make hard balls or
throw at a building. I never throw at anyone’s head.
It would make me feel very sad to hurt someone or
break a window.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Directing the sport of snowballing is far better and
wiser than prohibiting it. The discreet teacher will
not even try to suppress it, but will use every occasion
to get into the snow with the boys and girls and have
fun and frolic.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come on, Mr. Frank, first batter!” “Pitcher!”
“Catcher!” “First base!” Soon every position was
filled as the boys and the teacher of the eighth grade
streamed out of the schoolhouse.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come on, Mr. Frank, play with us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, not today, boys. I have something else to do
now, I can’t.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was the third and last time for the season that
the boys of Mount Holly School urged this young
man to enter into his privilege in play. He stood off
and for a few moments closely observed the outcome.
The game started after some parleying, but was soon
interrupted by dissension.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s out.” “You’re out.” “Throw him out.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_526'>526</span>“I won’t do it,” and scores of chopped-off utterances
filled the air. Ten minutes were lost in hot argument
out of which no one gained the least value. Big boys
squeezed smaller ones out of their turn and these,
lacking any opportunity for play, stood about occupied
with gloomy thoughts.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They don’t get on well together—I wonder what
the matter is with these fellows,” Mr. Frank remarked.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Accept the invitation to play. As a player, take
only a player’s part. No pedagogical authority need
be used; but as a private person exercise a control that
will give tone to the whole performance. See that
something like justice is done to all and that the foolish
delays are eliminated.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Boys little by little acquire a sense of order and
often become deeply offended at the unruly procedure
of their comrades. They welcome the presence of an
older hand that steadies affairs and prevents one or
two reckless boys or girls from spoiling the fun of all
the rest.</p>

<p class='c007'>An occasional participation may be all that is needed
to institute a noticeable improvement. Such aid should
be given heartily as it is due to the children in every

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 94 (SEVENTH AND EIGHTH GRADES)</h4>

<p class='c016'>The Cloverdale Grammar School gave much attention
to athletics and especially tried to encourage the
baseball team which had been organized from the seventh
and eighth grades. Mr. Tilden, the principal,
was sincere in his desire that his pupils should engage
in the sport, but having given his verbal encouragement
and assistance, it did not occur to him that his
personal presence on the playground was in any degree
necessary to the welfare of the school. He interpolated
but on restriction into the fun: “In order to
safeguard our school buildings,” he said to the boys,
“I am going to make one ruling, namely, that you must
not send the balls toward the school building. Any
boy who does that, accidentally or otherwise, must
drop out of the game.”</p>

<p class='c007'>All went well for a few days. The less aggressive
among the boys adhered to the rule strictly. But one
day one of the leading boys, Reginald Coleman, happened
to hit the stone foundation of the school building.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_528'>528</span>In this particular instance the stone foundation
was surmounted by brick walls up to about one-third
or one-half the height of the building, then finished off
for the remainder of the distance with wood.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reginald argued with much boyish eloquence that
“the foundation was not a part of the building, no
possible harm would result from hitting it with the
ball, hence it could not be that Mr. Tilden intended
to include that in his prohibition.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So much in earnest was Reginald in pleading his
case that the other boys were soon won to his way
of thinking, and he was allowed to continue in the
game.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the next few days Reginald’s modification of
Mr. Tilden’s rule was the law of the playground. Then
came another issue. Carl Story lost his balance slightly
just as he raised his bat to strike, the result being that
the ball glanced sidewise, striking the brick wall of
the school building. It was now Carl’s turn to present
a plea for leniency in the application of the law.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aw, ’tain’t fair to throw that out! It don’t do no
more harm to hit the brick than it does ter hit the
stone. That brick’s a part of the foundation. Didn’t
you fellers say the other day that we could hit the
foundation? It’s <i>all</i> foundation up to the top of
brick.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Now Carl happened to be playing in the same nine
as Reginald, and Reginald naturally espoused his
cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right, kids,” he joined in, “Carl didn’t hit
the building; he only hit the brick foundation. Let
him play on! We don’t want to lose this game. Go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_529'>529</span>on, Carl”—and Carl finished the game notwithstanding
the protests of the opposing nine.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the modifications of the rules went on from
day to day, always in favor of the larger and stronger
and more aggressive boys and always to the disadvantage
of the younger and smaller ones of the opposite
side.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Be on the ground when a new game is launched.
Study the possibilities for unfair playing (silently, of
course), and make every effort to establish rules that
will be just to all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do not stop at this point, however. Play with the
children frequently enough to learn at first hand
whether strict rules of honor are being observed or
whether the leaders are taking unfair advantage wherever
opportunity offers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Say to Reginald and Carl, “If one of the boys on
the other side had made that play would you have
wished to count it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>If the boys can not be converted to a desire for
strictly honest play, then see to it that the ringleader
gets no advantage from his trickiness. Say, “We’ll
have to throw out this whole game because it wasn’t
played quite fairly. Tomorrow we’ll have another
game to take the place of this one.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Boys are not unlike adults in that they are quick to
make rulings favorable to themselves or their party
<span class='pageno' id='Page_530'>530</span>and unfavorable to others. The surest way to make
men honest is to make dishonesty unprofitable. A
state inspector of weights and measures, remarking
recently upon the fact that a certain town in Michigan
had “fewer cases of short weights and measures than
any other town visited,” accounted for the fact by
saying, “It is an inland town with a settled population.
The grocers depend year after year upon the
same group of persons for customers. Under such
conditions any habitual shortage would certainly be
discovered and in the end would work harm to the
business. Hence all the grocers are honest there. It
doesn’t pay to be dishonest.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The “paying” side of honesty may not seem a very
high motive to hold before children; but with the
<i>habit</i> of honesty once formed, the altruistic ideal will
be much surer of lodgment when the children are old
enough to appreciate it. On the other hand the high
ideal without the habit is simply another expression
for hypocrisy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much is said today regarding play as a means of
training for the higher duties of life. It may indeed
be so, but on the other hand play may be the most
effective training possible for trickery, selfishness, and
every anti-social instinct. The remedy is <i>supervision</i>
of play and participation in it by leaders who know
how to suppress the evil impulses which there find
opportunity for expression, while stimulating the good.
Such a leader will study individually the pupils under
his supervision and be quick to adapt his regulations
to changes, not only in place and time, but also to the
personnel of his group.</p>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Modify Rules</div>

<p class='c007'>From scraps of conversations floating in through
the open window near which Mr. Tilden was accustomed
to sit correcting papers, as well as from sundry
complaints coming to him from the defeated “nine,”
Mr. Tilden got an inkling after a while that all was
not as it should be on the ball ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll come down and play with you after school
this afternoon,” he replied one day to a seventh grade
boy, who had come in to tell him that he wanted to
give up his place in the baseball nine.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We can’t win no games, Mr. Tilden,” said he,
“coz the other team ain’t square. They kid us all the
time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Tilden, true to his word, joined hands in the
game, purposely taking a place in the losing team.
Next to the ball ground was a tennis court. Between
the two fields was a high wire fence. Presently over
the fence went a ball, sent thither by a batter of the
opposing nine. Of course there was vexatious delay
while one of the boys went to hunt it up and bring it
back. Before the game had proceeded very far another
ball flew over the high wire fence, and later
another.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oho! I believe I can see through that game,”
thought Mr. Tilden. “The boys on the other team are
heckling these boys, wasting their time and strength
and confusing them more or less by sending the balls
over the fence in order to place these fellows at a disadvantage.
That needs a bit of attention.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The game over, he called all the boys to him. “Well,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_532'>532</span>boys, we had a fine game and I’m glad I came in if
my side did get beaten. But there’s just one rule I’d
like to change a little. Some of you fellows need to
practice striking so as to hit squarer than you did
today. It’s a great nuisance to have the balls go over
that fence. We’ll have it the rule hereafter that whoever
can’t do better than send his ball over there will
choose someone else to take his place while he drops
out for the remainder of the game. Probably he needs
to rest his arms a little. Anyhow we can’t have the
fun spoiled just for a few boys who haven’t practiced
enough.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This arrangement solved the immediate problem,
but Mr. Tilden found that new ones successively presented
themselves as one side or the other worked out
new devices for outwitting the opposite side. He did
not make the mistake again, however, of leaving the
boys to themselves entirely, but kept in touch with
the players and readjusted the rules as occasion
required.</p>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Half-hearted Coöperation</div>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Renaldo managed to keep on the good side of
most of his pupils, but he fell from his pinnacle of
power when he made the following announcement:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, if any of you want to go to Delevan to attend
the baseball meet I’ve nothing to say. I don’t believe
our team is going to do much, but we’ll see.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If the people outside hadn’t butted in and tried to
run our sports we would have come out all right.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know you want to win the state championship.
We came so near it last year that we should have a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_533'>533</span>good chance for it under favorable circumstances. But
we haven’t much of a team. I could have picked a winning
team, I believe; but town folks wanted to run the
thing, so we’ll see what comes of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After this vent of pique a big buzz of criticism arose.
However, when the contest came off at Delevan the
superintendent made the trip and shouted as loud as
anyone. Through some strange characteristic quality
he was able to throw cold water one day and build up
fires of enthusiasm the next.</p>

<p class='c007'>Later in the spring came this announcement:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll not have any more baseball games with out-of-town
teams this season. Our athletics are absorbing
too much attention; too many people are trying to run
things up here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course the crack pitcher went to the board of
education and got consent of the board to continue the
series of games as had previously been the custom.
Later the superintendent said, “Well, now, let me see
who wants to play.... All right, then, if these are
your players, go ahead.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>One simple rule applies here: develop a consistent
policy and cling to it. If grades are low, get behind
the team in every way and you can usually swing the
backward students into line on their studies, even when
there is no danger of losing place because of lame
lessons. Move the players around and use substitutes
frequently so that no one will fasten on a given post
as personal property.</p>

<p class='c007'>A strong man can organize the town folks so that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_534'>534</span>their support will be always helpful. In any case the
appearance of a milk and water policy must be avoided.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Athletics is as difficult to manage as a church choir.
A light-fingered touch is dangerous, as schoolboy passions
are not sensibly controlled many times. A disciplinarian
may lose his influence and position merely
through carelessness at this point. The appearance of
an autocratic control of games by the superintendent
is highly undesirable. The whole affair should be just
as democratic as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pupils know pretty well what is necessary for the
good of the school and if their good judgment is appealed
to by a respected and trustworthy superintendent
or principal, the best policies can usually be carried
out.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<p class='c016'>In the Bellevue High School a wise principal had
assisted in organizing some six entertainment companies
for appearance in the auditorium at stated
intervals during the season. Their programs were
made up of dramatic, musical or literary numbers, as
the members of each company decided. The Schwartz-Ensign
Concert Company made its appearance on November
10, and won the plaudits of a large house.
Friends in neighboring towns, relatives of some of the
performers, requested a reproduction of the entertainment.
After consultation with her colleagues,
Velma Schwartz gave a favorable answer to two
invitations.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Meeting Half Way</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_535'>535</span>Loretta met Velma afterwards and said, “Velma,
did we make a mistake in saying nothing to Miss
Pringle about these out-of-town trips? What will she
say?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why should she say anything? Our folks at home
are willing and I don’t see that we are getting in her
way. It makes no difference one way or the other
what she says.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Naturally, the news finally reached Miss Pringle,
high school principal and general overseer of the entertainment
programs. Two currents of thought
passed through her mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t see why, after all my care, they have taken
up their out-of-town trips without saying anything to
me. I’ll just nip this in the bud and tell them they
can’t go.” But a different notion drove out the earlier
one. “They have done no real wrong. It’s a compliment
to my training for them to receive these invitations.
I don’t see what harm can come from it.” But
a fragment of the former line of argument would
persist:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Velma is the girl who did it. She starred the
night of the program. Her friends are determined
to show her off elsewhere. No doubt she wanted to
add to her glory by keeping her scheme out of my
fingers. I have a notion to say to her that she might
better have talked the matter over with me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then good sense ruled her and what she actually
said was: “Why, Velma, I heard just lately that some
of your friends are planning to have you out at
Beecham Springs to give a program of music. What a
fine thing that is! It comes Friday night, I believe;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_536'>536</span>that makes it safe for your studies, so it’s going to
turn out well. Your father and mother are going with
you, I suppose? Well, then, that will be fine.”</p>

team next week—their grades are very low, and in
fact as matters stand now they would be shut out.”—(Superintendent’s
announcement in the assembly
room.)</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s bluffing. If our team doesn’t win he’ll be cut

<p class='c007'>“His voice was weak when he made that speech.
He won’t carry out his threat.”—(Second pupil.)</p>

<p class='c007'>“If, after all our team has done, he pulls Tom and
the Giant off the team, he’s a goner and he knows it.
He might as well save all this talk.”—(Third pupil.)</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just lie low, my boy. We’ve got him fixed. He’ll
jump a hundred feet in the air, if he falls into our
trap. Every man of us is out if one drops out, no
more games this year. No, he doesn’t know. But it’ll
get to him.”—(Member of the football team.)</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thought I’d best tell you so you could be prepared
for it. The boys have it all made up that they’ll
strike and call all the games off if you keep any one
or more of them from playing. They may be bluffin’
you; but I rather think not, for they don’t believe
they can beat Upper Kensington unless they can have
the boys they want to play on the team. Do as you
think best.”—(Citizen.)</p>

<p class='c007'>“Seems as though things are going a little crooked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_537'>537</span>some way. I wonder where I blundered. I didn’t expect
to set them going this way. Why don’t they get
to their books; they might know I’m going to do the
square thing by them. Probably I’ll have to ease up
their minds some way.”—(Worried superintendent.)</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Quit the bluff game; it’s playing with fire. Call in
the boys who are behind in their work and settle up
the matter of studies without any reference to playing.
Talk very little about what you are going to do in
checking up deficiencies. Do a few of these things and
let the talk come the other way. Hold out natural inducements
to good work and spare the threats for rare
occasions. “Barking dogs seldom bite,” is an old
saying that applies to those fearsome teachers who
forecast a terrible punishment and then let the matter
pass without further attention. Each occurrence of
a situation such as this is a loosened spoke in your
wheel of fortune. Don’t put yourself in the hands of
a conspiracy by playing a loose game in discipline.</p>

<p class='c016'>Miss McCord, of the Benton High School, was very
unpopular one winter because she had failed two star
basketball performers, and thus kept them from remaining
on the team. These players were in her advanced
algebra class, with about twenty other students,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_538'>538</span>all ardent basketball enthusiasts. One day she
said to Coith Burgess, who was not one of the players,
but who had been especially indignant at her firmness,
“I should like to see you for a moment, Coith, after
class.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Sacrificing Scholarship</div>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, <i>would</i> you?” Coith shaped the words with his
mouth, but uttered no sound, and Miss McCord did not
see the disrespectful response. When the class was
dismissed he started to go with the rest. Miss McCord,
seeing him go and thinking he had forgotten her request,
said to him, “Don’t forget, Coith,” and went on
with her conversation with another pupil. When she
had finished it, Coith was nowhere in sight. He had
gone on to the assembly room, where he was explaining
to all the disaffected his reasons for not doing as “the
old crank” had asked him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss McCord had no mind to pass over the matter
lightly. She talked at once to the principal, and the
two arranged a plan of treatment. Nothing was said
to Coith, but he was not asked to recite the next day,
nor did Miss McCord appear to hear him when he
volunteered. The next day the same thing happened;
Miss McCord did not seem to hear or see him at all.
That afternoon, Coith met Mr. Stacey, the principal,
in the hall. “How’s this, Burgess?” he inquired,
“You’re reported absent two days in succession in
advanced algebra.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Absent? Not a bit of it. I’ve been there all right,
but Miss McCord hasn’t asked me to recite. She
doesn’t give a fellow a chance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Were you there?... All right.” Mr. Stacey was
looking gravely at Coith. “What reason could Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_539'>539</span>McCord have had for not paying any attention to
you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Coith began to flush and stammer. Finally, he told
the story of his disobedience, rather sullenly but
frankly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why did you do it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know. Just natural meanness, I guess.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll tell you why you did it, Coith. You thought
it would make a little hero of you with all the basketball
crowd to be rude and insubordinate to Miss
McCord, just now when they all dislike her, because
she had the courage to stand by her guns in that affair.
It was a case of posing, and the thing has happened to
you that does happen sometimes to the poseur—she
took you at your word. If you chose to put an end to
your relations as teacher and student, she agreed to
accept the situation. As I see it, you are out of the
class and your own fault it is, too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course in the end Coith came back into the class,
after making all due apologies. He had learned the
lesson of coöperation; he had learned, too, to subject
his love of approbation to a standard of fairness and
reciprocity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The instinct for self-gratification often takes the
form of a pathological fondness for prominence and
the approval of others. In Coith’s case his sense of
fairness, courtesy, and submission to rightful authority
had all become subordinate to promptings of his
vanity and resentment. The course of Mr. Stacey and
Miss McCord restored in him the proper sense of the
relative importance of the admiration of his fellows
and a sound working relation with his teacher.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Jackman of the Ellensburg rural school and

<p class='c007'>She said: “Who would like to carry my basket?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I want to.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me,” came the response from various pupils.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Those who had offered their services were hurt at
not being chosen. Had the teacher said: “Will you
please carry my basket, Tom?” there would have been
a less poignant feeling among the others that favoritism
had been shown by the teacher.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (RURAL SCHOOL)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Organize Carefully</div>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Merryman was the jolliest teacher the children
of the Concord rural school ever had had. No other
teacher gave the children so many “outings”; no
other ever placed so much responsibility upon the
pupils on such vacations, and never before had responsibility
seemed so delightful as since Mr. Merryman
came to the school. “He’s just like his name,” declared
the children.</p>

<p class='c007'>One reason why Mr. Merryman had such success
<span class='pageno' id='Page_541'>541</span>in organizing little excursions which to other teachers
were most unwelcome bugbears, was that he announced
them long enough beforehand to give himself and the
children ample time to prepare for details.</p>

<p class='c007'>“One week from today,” said Mr. Merryman one
Friday afternoon, “we will all go on an excursion to
get materials for our aquarium. I will appoint Joseph
and Henry to look up, sometime between now and
Wednesday, the best route for the school to take down
to the creek. Remember, we want a dry path, for the
children must not get wet feet. Lucy and Ellen, James
and William may arrange for drag nets. Perhaps
we shall have to make some of them. You may find
out whether we can borrow them or not, and how much
the material will cost if we need to make them ourselves.
Henrietta and Edward may be sure that there
are suitable dishes for bringing home our trophies.
Find out just what we need.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Some of the little children won’t want to go so far
as the creek, where they have to be so still, so I will
appoint the sixth grade girls to form an entertainment
committee to find a pleasant place at some little distance
from the creek where the little ones can play.
You will have a stock of games ready to entertain them
while some of us are busy at the creek and when we
have enough things, animals, plants, etc., for our
aquarium, we will all come to the same place and
there we will have our lunches together. Doris,
Frieda and May of the girls, and Thomas, Fayette and
Wilbur of the seventh and eighth grade boys may be
the refreshment committee. The different committees
may get together next Monday and talk over their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_542'>542</span>plans. Make up your minds between now and then
just what you need to talk about. Have everything
planned and ready before the day of our excursion.
Meanwhile all of us, in the nature class, will study
about the aquarium and the animals that live in it.
Our first lesson will be on Monday, about ‘How to
make the aquarium.’ That is all for this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is needless to add that for a week the excursion
and the studies and talks connected with it furnished
many an hour of innocent and instructive diversion for
the eager children. When the day came every detail
had been thought out and prepared for so carefully
that the event was entirely successful. Looking forward
in expectation to the pleasure, filled the children’s
minds too full to leave much room for mischief,
and “discipline” in the sense of punishments sank
into its legitimate place, far into the background.</p>

<p class='c007'>Conferences with the teacher about matters which
were puzzling to the children brought teacher and
pupils into a close and delightful relationship which
made unkindly feeling toward the teacher or insubordination
almost out of the question. Once or twice
earlier in the year, when planning the excursion, Mr.
Merryman had been obliged to say, “But only those
will be invited whose work and conduct in school have
been satisfactory.” But even this precaution was now
unnecessary; he simply took the precaution to place
the more troublesome of the pupils on whatever committee
would have to consult most frequently with
himself. In this way the feeling of coöperation between
himself and them grew stronger with each succeeding
school “event.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_543'>543</span>(5) <i>Play and truancy.</i> There is no better preventive
of truancy than just such outings as that above
described, especially if the teacher is wise enough and
tactful enough to utilize some part of the day’s experiences
in the regular school work, nature study, geography,
history, etc. This is by no means difficult to do.
Such a course would have prevented entirely the unfortunate
situation of the following case.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 98 (SEVENTH GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Play and Truancy</div>

<p class='c007'>Darrow King deliberately planned the truancy of his
classmates one bright May day, although he did not
actually suggest it to them. He had been good a long
time, nothing exciting had happened since cold
weather, and he wanted to get out-of-doors and away
from the stuffy school-room. There was no fun in playing
truant alone, or he might have done that; he had
no grudge against Miss Haynes except as she represented
an irksome educational system of which he did
not approve. When he grew eloquent of fishing lines
and a warm sunny swimming hole out by Pike’s Mill,
every boy within sound of his voice felt the primal
impulse to take to the fields. So they did, leaving
seventeen girls and three righteous quitters to take
care of Miss Haynes and Grade Seven.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is Darrow King’s work,” said Miss Haynes
to herself. “If I don’t conquer that boy he’ll be running
the school before long. I’m fearing he’s on the
downward path.” So Darrow King was called before
the bar and arraigned. It was a private session after
school.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Darrow, I believe you planned that truancy, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_544'>544</span>I want you to tell me the truth about it. Didn’t you
tell the other boys to skip school last Friday afternoon?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, ma’am, I didn’t. I just said there was a good
place to fish out there, and that Mr. Pike would let
us swim below the dam, and all the fellows said they
wanted to go. I didn’t say they should, they just
wanted to.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps that’s true, but it was you who planned
it, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No’m, I didn’t plan it. I just remarked how nice
it would be for us all to go together if it wasn’t a school
day, and Bob Darcy he said let’s go anyway, and I
guess they all wanted to, for they did—except the two
Jones boys and the Righter kid.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nevertheless it was you that started it, wasn’t it?
Tell the truth, Darrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, yes, I s’pose I started it. I guess it was me,
all right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Darrow, don’t you realize what an influence
you have over the other boys? There is nothing so
great as the power of influence. I remember I wrote
my graduating theme upon The Power of Influence,
and I’ve noticed it ever since. You knew that playing
truant is one of the worst things you can do, and yet
you led those boys into temptation. What do you
think will be the end of a boy who enters into such
sin? You know that when we begin to sin we go from
bad to worse, and I hate to think of your going on the
downward path, Darrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By this time Miss Haynes had reduced herself to
tears at the image she was conjuring up of Darrow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_545'>545</span>sliding down the moral toboggan. Darrow, catching
his cue from her, began to look contrite and sorrowful.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Darrow, think of the power for good you might be,
if only you’d use your influence rightly. Instead of
teaching the boys to do wicked things, why not become
a great uplift in their lives? Had you ever thought of
that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, ma’am. But I’ll try to do better, Miss
Haynes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This rapid conversion to righteous resolutions completely
melted Miss Haynes. “I’m sure you will, Darrow.
That is all—I won’t punish you this time, for I
expect you to use your personal influence to bring
these thoughtless and perverse boys into better ways
of thinking and doing. Only think of the power for
good that you have!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Darrow left the room with a step that fairly sang
of a chastened soul resolved to bring all its erring
kind into the fold of holy endeavor. He kept this up
until he was well away from the schoolhouse, when
he broke into a mad run and was soon with the other
boys in Farrell’s pasture, where they were playing
ball. Here he recounted his interview with Miss
Haynes, not omitting the pathetic passages, amid
shouts of laughter. Needless to say, his “great influence
over the boys” was not exerted in the interests
of good order that year. The boys continued to do
what they had done before, and Darrow led them as
of old.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_546'>546</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Talk with two or three of the leading boys, including
Darrow, and ask them about the fishing trip. Show
them that you understand “the call of the wild” that
comes with May sunshine. But “put it up to them” if
playing truant is the square thing to do, either to the
school or to their parents. Why should one attend
school regularly? Is it honorable to sneak off without
permission? What is to be done about it? Assume
that of course the boys will do something about it.
Who can suggest a fair way of making this wrong
right? Probably some one will suggest that the time
be made up, or that the lessons missed be written out
and handed in. Arrange with this small group what
is to be suggested to the larger group. As to Darrow,
without telling him that he is the leader, enlist him in
some project that will identify him with school interests.
Perhaps he can plan an outdoor gymnasium, lay
out a tennis court, or superintend the putting up of
bird-houses. By this means get him gradually to work
with you until you and he have formed a solid friendship.
Identify him with your own leadership; form a
partnership with him. Truancy will disappear under
such conditions, for real friendship will develop between
teacher and pupils.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some pupil leaders are useful allies, others are
worthy enemies who may outgeneral the ranking officer.
A wise teacher sets himself first of all to win to
his loyal support the natural leaders of the pupils.
This is done by first winning their admiration and
respect, then by stressing some interest which the
teacher and student leaders have in common, thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_547'>547</span>making common cause with them until sympathetic
relations are established. Study your leading pupils;
find out their hobbies, their friends, their ambitions.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Children instantly detect the mawkish note in a
teacher’s dealings with them, and appreciate it keenly
if they have any sense of humor. The most of them
have. Miss Haynes was over-emotional, and made the
blunder of appealing to feelings which Darrow did not
possess. Never talk to a child leader about his leadership.
To do so either makes him vain, or robs him of
his ability through the development of self-consciousness.
Miss Haynes did not appeal to a boy’s interests.
A boy does not usually care to lead his companions to
moral heights. He does not like “Sunday language.”
He does not think he is slipping into perdition when
he plays truant; and many grown people think he is
right. Miss Haynes failed because she did not know
enough about boy nature to make a real appeal to a
boy. She had so little sympathy with the play spirit
that she did not even sympathize with the boys’ response
to the call of a swimming hole. Because she
could not appeal to the leader, his leadership continued
to be against her authority and against the best interests
of the school.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Indulge the Hobby</div>

<p class='c007'>A teacher in an orphan asylum won the friendship
and support of a boy who had caused much trouble,
by discovering that he was very fond of animals, and
that he had a tame opossum and several trained dogs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_548'>548</span>The teacher could not afford to buy and give him books,
but he brought him, each Monday, from the public
library, a new book about animals. Through a discussion
of Cy de Vry and his methods, the teacher convinced
the boy that he had a real interest in dumb
creatures, and after that there was no more trouble
with the group who were under this boy’s influence.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION 2 (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Camera Club</div>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Claud Jakeway of the Williamstown rural high
school was much annoyed by the frequent absences of
two or three members of the Freshman class. The
excuses given him were: “Didn’t feel well enough to
study,” “Had to help father,” etc. A little private
investigation convinced Mr. Jakeway, however, that
the real cause in each case was truancy, generally, for
the purpose of either hunting or fishing. Mr. Jakeway
studied over his problem for some days, then one
morning made the following announcement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I noticed a few days ago in one of my periodicals
that certain magazines devoted to country life and its
interests are advertising for original photographs of
wild animals taken in their native habitat. I am
greatly interested in this myself, for I am exceedingly
fond of wild life, and immensely enjoy a day in the
woods now and then. I wonder if some of you older
boys wouldn’t like to join with me to form a Camera
Club. We’ll go out on Saturdays and take our lunches.
Only a few can associate together effectively in work
which must be done so quietly, so I shall limit the membership
to four besides myself. Hunting wild animals
with a camera is sport enough for anybody, but we’ll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_549'>549</span>take our fish poles along in case we don’t happen to
strike ‘game.’ By the end of the month the birds will
be here and the hibernating animals will be out of their
winter’s sleep. Please think this matter over and see
how many of you would like to spend your Saturdays
in the way I have indicated. Beside the limitation in
numbers, I shall place only one restriction upon the
membership of the club, that is, that we can accept in it
only those whose attendance in school has been regular.
I realize of course that those who have lost time
in school will need their Saturdays in order to make
up back work, so please keep that also in mind between
this and the end of the month. Then we will decide
who is eligible for membership.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Jakeway’s plan was effective. Initiative in coöperation
and substitution accomplished the needed
reform.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Curiosity, Legitimate, and Otherwise</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Curiosity is the beginning of all knowledge.</div>
      <div class='line in44'>—<i>Plato.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Curiosity is the intellectualized form of the adaptive
instinct. Children who lack it are subnormal; and yet
some teachers seem to think that curiosity is a sin and
should be inhibited. Like all other instincts, it must
be controlled; and part of every child’s education is
the acquiring of ability to control his curiosity, to
know when to give it free rein and when to curb it.
It must not be indulged at the expense of the right of
others to quiet, or to the undisturbed possession of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_550'>550</span>property, or to the opportunity of doing their work;
in short, the legitimate satisfaction of curiosity stops
where the rights of other people begin.</p>

<p class='c007'>Curiosity is not, then, a vice to be conquered, but a
fundamentally healthful, natural, and progress-bringing
instinct. The greater part of the curiosity of children
is about matters which they need to know, and it
can be utilized in motivating work; a fact which, once
understood, changes an annoyance into an asset.</p>

<p class='c007'>But sometimes children are inquisitive about things
which should not concern them; their curiosity conflicts
with good taste and a true sense of propriety, or with
the rights of others. Moreover, unrestrained curiosity
often interferes with the fulfillment of duty, or it develops
unwholesome appetites and precocious sophistication.
Children are also often curious about many
things which can not properly be explained to them
until a fuller knowledge gives them an interpretative
basis; and for this curiosity the wisest treatment is
postponed satisfaction, with a clear explanation for the
reason. Such an answer to questions which can not
well be answered at once is far better than the evasive
or lying replies with which too many parents and
some teachers put off children. Boys and girls will
usually accept a postponement of the answer, if they
are convinced that if given they could not understand
it, and they will set themselves to the mastery of the
prerequisites. But they easily and soon discover lies
in the answers given them (usually these lies are too
clumsy to deceive a bright child very long), and then,
knowing they can not depend upon the lawful and
natural source of information, they set about finding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_551'>551</span>answers by whatever means offers. Questions of religion
and sex especially, should be answered with a
definite promise of satisfaction when the time comes,
rather than with a misleading or evasive reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>Teachers should analyze the nature of the curiosity
of their pupils. They will find that it will fit one of
these four cases:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>1.</dt>
    <dd>Legitimate curiosity, which should be satisfied at once, and in such a way as to 
    stimulate further interest in the things concerned.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.</dt>
    <dd>Legitimate curiosity, which can not wisely be satisfied at once, but which should be put 
    off with a frank statement that when the child is older and can understand the knowledge 
    sought for, it will be given.
    </dd>
    <dt>3.</dt>
    <dd>Curiosity which is pathological or idle, or the satisfaction of which interferes with the 
    rights of others.
    </dd>
    <dt>4.</dt>
    <dd>Curiosity not harmful in itself, but which interferes with the child’s own wholesome 
    development.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c007'>(1) <i>Curiosity stimulated by novelty or by spirit of
investigation.</i> This is the form of curiosity which Plato
so much admired, yet most parents and teachers dub
it just plain “meddling.” Perhaps they have not realized
the possibilities for growth in it that Plato saw.</p>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Meddling</div>

<p class='c007'>Louis Gannin came into his first year of school life
with a surplus of interest in whatever struck his senses.
His movements were very rapid, his attention was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_552'>552</span>fluctuating and his hand deft in opening boxes and
other receptacles for articles of any sort.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Louis, is that you?” said his teacher one morning.
He was visible only as a mass of child’s garments, for
he stood doubled up over a pile of rubbish in a hall
closet.</p>

<p class='c007'>And so it was on many occasions, until Miss Vanderlip
broke down in despair:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Louis, I think you must have looked at everything
there is in this whole school building by this time. I
have told you not to get into things and still you do it.
What shall I do with you, anyway?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Louis looked down at his shoes in undisturbed
innocence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know what I’ll do with you. I’ll just tie your
hands together for a long time, so as to teach you not
to get into things. How’ll you like that? Then you’ll
be like a prisoner with handcuffs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Louis did not know very much about handcuffs or
prisoners, nor could he help but wonder how it would
feel to have his hands tied together. He meekly let
the matter rest because teacher was apparently not in
a very good mood.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>We advise Miss Vanderlip to substitute permissible
investigations for forbidden ones; provide something
every day which will absorb attention and if possible
exhaust the inquiring impulses of this boy. Give him
privileges, not punishment. Get an old clock, bring
flowers, an old book, a skeleton of a small animal or
bird. Bring out one at a time. Watch his reactions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_553'>553</span>after receiving them; note what appeals to him most.
Connect these extras with his lessons as far as possible
so that he may see no dividing line between work and
play. Avoid scolding but drive hard on the search for
facts. Saturate him with discoveries, so that he will
not have time to pry into forbidden things.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Louis had no more need of punishment than a fledgling
when first he tries to fly. Boys’ hands were made to
open up things, not to be handcuffed. He has an appetite;
the way to satisfy it is to feed, not disappoint it.</p>

<p class='c007'>He is subject to direction. If let alone he will go
far wrong; if coerced he will go wrong the sooner; if
helped he may become a famous scholar.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (THIRD GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Busy Work</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Frederick never let her wits fail when it came
to providing interesting material for children. Stories—she
could tell them by the hour and make her children
laugh or cry as she would. Something to do,
delightful little tasks that were play, not work, an
unlimited assortment of these she had always at hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>For some of the most eager ones she kept on hand
a supply of busy work which was brought out as a
special reward for diligence.</p>

<p class='c007'>For Janie and Rhoda, the two irrepressibles, she
had a small collection of Chinese paper dolls, no two
alike, or some needle-work, or a specimen from the
woods. At times she sent Janie out to bring natural
objects.</p>

<p class='c007'>“See how many different things you can bring in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_554'>554</span>to me from that maple tree, and Rhoda, bring as many
different kinds of parts from the rose-bush as you can
find. They must be tiny and no two alike.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At another time she called for different kinds of
soil, stone, cloth, pictures, and when the list seemed
exhausted, she repeated items on it without any loss
of interest because some new characteristic concerning
them was brought to the attention of the curious, wondering,
little investigators.</p>

<p class='c007'>The child that pays too much attention to what other
pupils are doing needs only to be interested in his own
work. He should not be punished. The teacher should
discover what in his schoolmate’s work interests him
and then give him the same kind of work. Such a
pupil should cause a teacher no trouble. It is a matter
of keeping him interested and busy, and that is not a
difficult task for the skillful teacher.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mildred Trott spent all her time listening to the recitations
of other classes, which caused her to fail in her
own. Her teacher, Miss Ware, had often talked to her
about this, and Mildred had often resolved to do better;
but when the fascinating recitations began in front of
her, she listened to them in spite of good resolutions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, one day, Miss Ware saw her watching the
class at the front of the room, while her own small
geography lay closed on her desk.</p>

<p class='c007'>She smiled, stood up, and said in a clear voice:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Mildred Trott, Mildred Trott,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hears that which concerns her not!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_555'>555</span>The other children laughed a little, Mildred opened
her book hastily, and the incident passed. But at recess
Miss Ware heard Mildred’s playmates repeat the
bit of doggerel, and Mildred did not seem to like it.
The next day Mildred held her book open, but she still
slyly listened to the recitation instead of studying.
Miss Ware again stood up, and repeated clearly—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Open book availeth not;</div>
      <div class='line'>You must <i>study</i>, Mildred Trott.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This time the children laughed more, and two or
three put down the couplet before they forgot it, in
the flyleaves of their books. Again they teased Mildred
at recess, and Mildred began to see that she must overcome
her curiosity or endure continual teasing. The
next day and the next she studied assiduously, and had
good lessons. On the next day, feeling very sure of
herself, she fell from grace. When Miss Ware saw
her leaning forward eagerly to hear the advanced
spelling lesson, she stopped long enough to chant—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Mildred’s class is not in session;</div>
      <div class='line'>Mildred, work upon your lesson!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This was the last bit of doggerel that was needed.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>The illustration given above was sent to the president
of the International Academy of Discipline with
the following comment, which was intended to justify
the method employed:</p>

<p class='c007'>The correction came in a friendly way, but its form
enlisted the whole school (for children love rhymes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_556'>556</span>and will repeat them in and out of season) in the corrective
process. The need for well-prepared lessons
had not been an incentive strong enough to induce
Mildred to overcome her instinctive curiosity, but the
ridicule of her schoolmates gave enough additional incentive
to stir her will to action.</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of the fact that the method is supposed to
have been effective in dealing with “Mildred Trott,”
we can not believe that the method is good enough to
recommend. On the contrary, we believe that, in most
instances, any such attempt on the part of the teacher
to bring ridicule to bear on one pupil is sure to rouse
resentment. Hostility between pupil and teacher is
likely to cause more trouble to the teacher and be more
harmful to the pupil than the habit of listening to
others recite.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the teacher finds it necessary to speak to the child
at all about the habit of listening to others recite, after
she has already made the attempt to interest the child
in his own work, she should take the matter up with
the child, individually. An effective way to apply the
principle of initiative in coöperation is to approach
the child with a smile on your face, when he is alone,
and in the same breath that you speak of his habit of
listening to others, mention the fact that you used to
have trouble, too, keeping your mind concentrated.
Do not say this unless it is true. But it is true of most
of us, and to tell this to the child gets results in most
cases. Suggest that he try to concentrate daily. Approve
him now and then upon his progress.</p>

<p class='c007'>In dealing with curiosity, the general truth that
ideals clearly defined help immensely in gaining control
<span class='pageno' id='Page_557'>557</span>of natural tendencies, holds. Fine and high ideals
of the rights of others, of what is appropriate and
just, must constantly be kept before young people to
help them in directing and mastering their instincts.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 100 (FOURTH GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>“Trying on” Clothing</div>

<p class='c007'>The children in Valley Grove School had an insatiable
curiosity concerning unfamiliar things, which annoyed
Miss Freeman, their teacher, exceedingly. She
was a city woman, with no idea of the restricted lives
her pupils lived. They were crudely inquisitive,
coming from homes which were morally wholesome, but
uncultured or even boorish in manners. Miss Freeman
was anxious to help them, but was very young and not
well prepared. She went home every week-end, and
every day the carrier left a letter for her at the schoolhouse.</p>

<p class='c007'>She wore pretty clothes, which the little girls admired
greatly. One day Maggie Linton touched the
silken sweater which they all liked so much, and then
Erna wondered how it felt to wear such a garment;
and the result was that Ollie Bain put on sweater,
hat and gloves, and was turning around in a small
circle of admiring femininity when Miss Freeman came
into the hall.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, you naughty girls!” she exclaimed. “You
mustn’t touch other people’s things. Take them off,
Ollie. You may look at them, but you mustn’t handle
them; hasn’t your mother taught you that? Look how
dirty your hands are, Ollie. I’ll have to have my
gloves cleaned.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She was not angry, for she liked the children and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_558'>558</span>had a good disposition. But she failed to <i>use</i> the girls’
curiosity, and she failed to generalize the principles
that teach children when curiosity may be satisfied and
when it must be controlled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Teacher, why do you get a letter every day, and
who writes it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Carl Voegling asked the question one rainy recess,
while all the other children stood at ecstatic attention
to hear what the answer would be.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Carl, that’s not any of your business, and you are
not to ask me personal questions,” Miss Freeman answered.
The children saw her cheeks grow pink, and,
having been brought up to think it legitimate fun to
tease people, they continued slyly to refer to the letters
throughout the year.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Watching Mail</div>

<p class='c007'>One day, the teacher came into the hall to find
George Funk examining the envelope of the letter that
had come that morning. She was very angry this
time, and told George, a boy of twelve, to stay in at
recess for a week. She thought she had come just in
time to prevent his opening and reading the letter,
and told him that after this she would keep her mail
in the desk, since she could not trust her pupils out of
her sight. George had not really meant to read the
letter, and feeling that her remarks were unjust, became
very sullen.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the week was almost up, Miss Freeman herself
had an impulse of curiosity. “Why did you want
to read my letter, George?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t want to read your letter,” he answered.
“I just wanted to see the postmark.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But what good would that do you?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_559'>559</span>“Well, I wanted to know where it was from.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But why? You know I like you, George,” in a
sudden rush of compunction at the hurt, sullen look on
George’s face; “do tell me, why did you want to know
where it was from?”</p>

<p class='c007'>George hesitated a moment, then his story came out
in a rush. “Well, at home they all were talking about
your letters, and my brother Curt said that he bet they
were from that fellow in Carlinville that he saw you
with one day. And he dared me to look at the envelope
and see what the postmark was. He said he’d
let me drive the bay colt if I would.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you tell your brother Curt that he ought to
be ashamed of himself to set you at such tricks. You
needn’t stay in this afternoon, George. But next time,
remember, keep your hands off what doesn’t belong
to you.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Let each manifestation of curiosity be the means of
leading pupils to a broader life. When she found
Ollie garbed in the sweater, Miss Freeman might have
said: “Would you like me to tell you where this
sweater came from, and what I saw when I wore it last
summer in Estes Park? There are so many stories connected
with it—just as there are about Ollie’s silk hair-ribbon.
Let us hang it over this chair while we’re
talking about it; I’m always very careful never to
handle it unless my hands are clean, and always to
keep it on a hanger lest it lose its shape.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In this way the children’s healthy curiosity about
strange and pretty things is satisfied, their knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_560'>560</span>increased, and some ideas on the proper care of clothing
inculcated. The lesson about silk-worms and spinning
and weaving processes is twice as vivid, therefore
twice as well learned, when it bears on the pretty silk
sweater before them, as it would be when read in the
course from a book.</p>

<p class='c007'>The curiosity about the letter was of a kind which
needs to be inhibited, but Miss Freeman should have
inquired into his motives before, not after punishing
George. Even then, perhaps, he deserved a punishment
of some sort, but it would have been given with
the knowledge that the fault was really his brother’s.
The incident gave the teacher a splendid chance to
teach a lesson in the ethics of property-treatment.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>In this case the elder brother’s curiosity was the
outgrowth of a healthy love of life and romance which
his too narrow life was starving into a desire to feed
upon the personal affairs of the teacher. Village
gossip grows from just this condition—natural interest
in the picturesque elements of life, which the too restricted
life of a small community bound by many
prejudices and traditions forces into unwholesome
channels. Miss Freeman’s pupils shared the interest
of their elders in the attractive teacher’s clothes, movements,
and half-revealed romance, besides having their
own healthy curiosity in one whose life was so much
broader and richer than their own. This curiosity gave
the teacher a thousand chances to teach manners, facts,
and self-control to her boys and girls, but she did not
know how to utilize them.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_561'>561</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION 1 (THIRD GRADE)</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>When Miss Murray came to the third grade she
found bad conditions as to attention. A street car line
went by the school and every time a car passed the
children all looked up from their books until it had
gone out of sight.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Watching Street cars</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Murray at once put up sash-curtains, thick
enough effectively to shut out the sight of the street
cars. She found the upper sashes nailed shut, as the
former teacher had opened the lower sashes only. She
had these unnailed, and the shades hung at the window
sill instead of from the top of the window. This
enabled her to shut out the sight and sound of the
street cars pretty effectively. After several months,
the children forgot to look out of the window even
when they could see the cars; the habit of attention
to work had been fixed through the elimination of the
lures to curiosity.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION 2 (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Visiting Exhibit</div>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Babbitt, the leading citizen of Hoopeston, had
just returned from a long trip to the Orient. As he was
wealthy, he had brought back a great many curios and
art treasures; and as he was public-spirited, he arranged
to exhibit these in the large assembly room of
the high school building, and to lecture about them
to any who cared to come. While the exhibits were
being arranged, the high school students did not use
the assembly hall, as Mr. Babbitt, aided by several assistants,
was busy unpacking and putting things into
place. However, the students came to Mr. Tower, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_562'>562</span>principal, to ask that they be allowed to go into the
assembly room at noon to look at things.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hardly know what to do about this,” said Mr.
Tower, in chapel, “but I feel that young people of
your age and training should be able to go to see these
things, enjoy them, and not injure or even handle them
at all. Therefore, I asked Mr. Babbitt if you might
go in at noon, after giving a pledge that you would
not touch or handle anything. He said he would
trust you if I could, and so we have decided that you
may go into the room at noon, by giving a signed promise
to this effect to the servant whom Mr. Babbitt
leaves there at the door.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This plan worked excellently. Practically the whole
school spent the greater part of their noon hours for
several days looking at the quaint and lovely things
Mr. Babbitt had brought. Not one thing was hurt or
even touched, although a small vase was broken by
accident when some boys, examining the contents of a
temporary shelf, fell over each other in their eagerness.
But the boys volunteered to pay for this loss,
and Mr. Babbitt was entirely satisfied.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Tower could not have trusted his students so
fully had not he and many other teachers and parents
taught ideals of self-control and honor for a long time
preceding this test. The principal’s talk and the written
pledge were means of bringing and keeping before
the students’ minds the ideal of controlled curiosity,
of a desire to touch inhibited by the will.</p>

<p class='c007'>This ideal of a fine sense of honor controlling the
instinct to touch, take apart, roll, toss or otherwise
experiment with anything that arouses interest, should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_563'>563</span>be taught very early in school life. Little children
want to handle everything, including work material,
playthings, ornaments, books, curios, pictures; older
ones want to handle instruments and apparatus used
in their laboratories. “Mine and thine” must early
be differentiated, and the satisfaction of curiosity by
handling limited to one’s own possessions. If this be
taught in the home and the primary grades, older
children will be found as reliable as Mr. Tower’s students
when a serious test comes.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) <i>Curiosity stimulated by destructive-constructive
impulses.</i> Even very young children take pleasure
in pulling things to pieces—not so much because of
a wish to destroy as because of the pleasure of producing
effects. Destroying is easier than constructing, so
naturally destructiveness develops before constructiveness.
But the latter characteristic becomes relatively
stronger as ability to do difficult things increases.
With boys from twelve to fifteen years of age the instinct
sometimes becomes almost a mania. Then is the
time that the wise parent or teacher will find a means
for harmless ways of indulging an inclination that
may develop later into genius, and in any case will
bring much first-hand information.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 101 (EIGHTH GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Dismembering Piano</div>

<p class='c007'>Bert Slocum came from a miner’s home where the
comforts of life were so few as to mar sadly the development
of growing children. Bert said to himself
one day:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know how I can have a good time. Some Saturday
night I’m going to borrow a dark lantern, take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_564'>564</span>along some lunch and I’ll go to the schoolhouse and
stay all night. I’ll take enough to eat to last me over
Sunday. I’ll stay up there all day Sunday and take
the piano to pieces and put it together again. I can
do it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The program was actually carried out. What a
glorious time he had. No one came to interrupt, no
one called him to dinner and nothing marred the
luxury of those sweet hours.</p>

<p class='c007'>His parents knew nothing of his whereabouts, but
that did not disturb him, for every so often he was
absent anyway and no one was much concerned.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unfortunately he had to finish his work in the nightfall,
as his supply of oil was exhausted the night preceding.
He had taken out nearly every bolt and screw
until he came to the sounding board and its strings.
When darkness furnished a shelter from inquisitive
eyes he emerged from the building, called on a friend,
and finally reached home without giving an alarm.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Monday the janitor found traces of Bert’s adventure.
For one thing the piano was not all put
back together, for the pedals lay in a heap at one
side.</p>

<p class='c007'>The teachers were notified and inquiry began. The
superintendent decided it was not a little boy and
looked to the eighth grade to furnish the culprit.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a great deal of noisy inquiry, Bert held up his
hand and said to the teacher: “I know something
about that piano.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you know, Bert?” said his teacher.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll tell, but I want to know what you all will do
with the kid, after I talk about him.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_565'>565</span>“We can’t say about that. Bert, if you know, it’s
time for you to speak out and have it over.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t want to, now; I’ll tell some time,” was
Bert’s final remark. Later he went to the superintendent
and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Knowles, is your pianner hurt some? I hear
some un’s been tinkering with it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know that it’s hurt much. But somebody
has been doing a trick we simply can’t stand. Just
think of it. You can see the whole thing has been in
pieces. I’ll have to suspend the boy that did this thing,
if I find him. I simply can’t stand it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing came immediately of this interview, but
Bert went home, turned the matter over carefully in
his mind, and in the morning came to school with a
grim determination to act, and perish if need be. On
the way he said to himself:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d eat fire, before I’d hurt the pianner. If I
have hurt it, as they think, I’ll just take my medicine
like a man.” And he did. He said very briefly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I tore up your pianner, Mr. Knowles.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The superintendent replied very shortly: “I’m
sorry, Bert, I’ll have to suspend you for a month for
that, so as to keep other boys from doing the same
thing, or something worse.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Give Bert an opportunity to talk out all of his
thought about the piano. Wait until he has told all,
and you have planned a substitute for piano-wrecking
before informing him of the gravity of his misconduct.
Possibly that item can be passed over lightly.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_566'>566</span>Get answers to these questions: “Are you particularly
interested in pianos or do you take an interest
in all kinds of mechanisms? What are you planning
to do for a living? What would you do if I found you
a place in a piano store, or in a machine shop, for spare
time work? Would you stiffen up your studies?
Would your parents be willing for me to make an arrangement
of this sort? How will you pay for having
a piano man go over our instrument and see that
everything is in order?”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>This boy has broken out of the usual beat of pupil
activities. The great question is, will his teachers be
equal to their opportunity? Curiosity is hunger for
experience; it lives at the basis of all knowledge. It is
a capital stock for educators; it can not be wasted
without impoverishing both the pupil and society.</p>

<p class='c007'>In dealing with Bert, motive counts for nearly everything.
He must not be made to suffer for his mistake
of judgment in such a way as to imperil his future
interest in school or in his favorite inquiries.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (EIGHTH GRADE)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Lavia Smiley came into the eighth grade with a consuming
passion for color sensations. She had made
collection after collection of colors in all sorts of substances—cloth,
paper, stone, soil, metals of various
sorts. She could give the names of all of them and
could imitate them in pigment mixtures with remarkable
exactness, for a girl of her age and very limited
experience.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Breaking Necklace</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_567'>567</span>One day, in the nature study class, Lavia’s teacher,
Miss Westfeldt, had given a lesson on shells, and among
other interesting things had shown the class a necklace
of iridescent shells which her missionary brother had
sent her from Micronesia. The lovely bluish-whitish-greenish-pinkish
shimmer of the shells riveted Lavia’s
attention like a magnet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, please, Miss Westfeldt, let me take them,” said
Lavia.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, Lavia,” answered Miss Westfeldt, “they are
too delicate to handle, but I’ll hold them here in the
sunlight where you can see them well. Aren’t they
beautiful!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, I never saw any thing so pretty!” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lesson ended, the necklace was laid back in the
cotton in which it had taken its long journey over sea
and land. Miss Westfeldt placed the box on the desk,
intending to take it home with her when she went to
lunch, but just as the morning session was closing, a
telegram was handed her requiring an immediate
answer. In her haste to attend to this intrusive matter,
and yet not forfeit her lunch, the box with its precious
necklace was forgotten.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first bell was ringing when Miss Westfeldt
returned.</p>

<p class='c007'>She made haste to be in her place, as the children
entered the room, and not until they were seated did
she think of the shell-necklace. She opened the box.
Ten were broken.</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, what has happened to my beautiful shells!”
she cried out, in dismay. “How were they broken?”</p>

<p class='c007'>No one answered, but Lavia was crying. Miss Westfeldt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_568'>568</span>immediately suspected that she was the guilty
party, but she only said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am very, very sorry that this has happened, but
never mind about it just now. I am sure the one who
broke them will come and tell me about it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lavia continued to weep and after the other children
were busy with their study Miss Westfeldt stepped
quietly up to her and, bending over her and speaking in
a tone so low the other children could not hear, said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lavia, dear, what is the matter?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, Miss Westfeldt, I broke your shells,” whispered
Lavia, and then burst into another freshet of tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am so sorry,” was the low reply. “After school
tonight come and tell me all about it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>School closed. Lavia remained; and when all the
other children had gone, Miss Westfeldt sat down beside
her, put her arm around the child, her hand resting
lightly on Lavia’s shoulder, and said, still in a low
tone:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, Lavia, tell me how it all happened.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, Miss Westfeldt,” began Lavia; “I wanted so
bad to see if I could paint the shells. I just ate a little
bit of lunch and hurried back quick before the children
got here, and made this little painting of the shells.
Then I started to put them back in the box carefully;
and I heard somebody open the entry door as if they
were coming in, and I jumped and dropped the shells,
and when I picked them up they were all broken. I
am awfully sorry, Miss Westfeldt. I’ll give you my
painting,” and the lips quivered again.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Westfeldt looked at the painting. It confirmed
Lavia’s story. The different colors were crude, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_569'>569</span>remarkably good for a thirteen-year-old girl. They
indicated artistic promise. The teacher sat for a moment
with an absorbed expression on her face, then
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lavia, you have grieved me very much today by
breaking these shells; now, will you do something to
make me happy again? I did not know this morning
why you wanted to take the shells. If I place the box
on your desk where you can study the color effects
and try to paint them, will you promise me that you
will try never again to meddle with things that you
have no right to touch?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, yes, Miss Westfeldt, I will, indeed I will! And
can I really have them on my desk?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Lavia, and I will keep your painting as a
pledge of your promise. If you will ask me, after your
lessons are learned, I have some other beautiful things
also, that you may paint. I am pleased that you told
me all the truth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lavia kept her promise. The spirit of initiative in
coöperation won.</p>

<p class='c007'>Carl Lampey and George Coffman were two sixth

<p class='c007'>“Whose is it?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We don’t know. Mr. Shorey (the janitor) said
he thought it used to belong to Mr. Taney. Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_570'>570</span>Taney’s been gone three years, and never has sent
for it. We want to take it apart to see how it’s
made.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s a good idea,” Miss Moore replied. “But I
can’t give you permission to do it until we find that
Mr. Taney really doesn’t want it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, Miss Moore, if he did want it, don’t you suppose
he’d have sent for it by this time? It’s too old
to be of any use, or he’d have sold it second-hand. And
we want to see how a typewriter’s constructed. Please,
Miss Moore.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The fact remains that it is not our property, and
we have no right to take it. I’ll tell you what to do,
though. Write to Mr. Taney and ask him. If he says
he’s done with it, take it with my blessing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But we don’t know Mr. Taney’s address.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then hunt it up; you can. I think he knew the
Wallaces very well, and doubtless they have it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So Carl and George went to the Wallace home, secured
Mr. Taney’s address, and wrote to him. Mr.
Taney was a busy principal in a large town, who laid
the letter aside and forgot to answer it for weeks.
Carl and George teased Miss Moore to let them take
the old machine, saying that Mr. Taney’s silence gave
consent. Miss Moore told them they must wait until
the owner gave up his property definitely. Finally,
a letter came from Mr. Taney, saying he had forgotten
all about the machine and that they were welcome to it;
and two happy boys, who had learned a valuable lesson
in self-restraint and honor, began to satisfy their
healthy curiosity as to the construction of a typewriter.</p>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Examining Record Book</div>

<p class='c007'>The morning after the report cards were given out
in the Bridgewater High School, Miss Penfield held a
series of conferences concerning marks; among them
one proved tragic.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t understand why I got only 65 in English
this month, Miss Penfield.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is what your daily recitations and test work
averaged.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You gave Harriet 82 and she admits that she
didn’t recite as many times as I did, and you gave
Elizabeth 75, and she never studies. I don’t see why
I got such a low mark when Elizabeth had as many
zeros as I did.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do you know how many zeros you had?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I looked at your record book when you were out
of the room.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rhoda Kilborne! Do you mean to say you would
do such a thing as that? That notebook is my personal
property. I wonder how many more pupils have had
access to it. Well! we shall see!”</p>

<p class='c007'>At the beginning of the recitation period, Miss Penfield
asked: “How many persons in this room have
ever looked at my record book?” There was no response
to her question. Every one sat motionless,
wondering what was going to happen next.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_572'>572</span>“Well, Rhoda, I guess you are the only culprit this
time.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I want you all to know that looking at a teacher’s
record book is no less than opening her pocket-book and
taking some money.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may report to me at the close of school,
Rhoda.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Open your record book so that the pupil can see how
her average was obtained. Say to her, “Suppose you
put the marks for your daily recitations on the board
and find out the average. Now average this with your
test work.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t you see, now why your mark was—?”</p>

<p class='c007'>At the beginning of the recitation period, pass your
book around the class, saying: “There may be some
who would like to know on what basis their average was
obtained. I work on the scale of —. Let us figure
out a few of the marks. Then, taking a good mark
as an example, show the pupils exactly how it was
obtained.</p>

<p class='c007'>Occasionally ask members of the class to exchange
papers and mark each other’s papers. Go over them
again yourself, giving your own mark. Ask those who
marked tests to compare their marks with yours.</p>

<p class='c007'>A teacher’s record book should not be regarded as
her private property. Play so fair with your pupils
that they will not want to look in your book without
permission. Have an understanding with them that
they are always privileged to ask to look at their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_573'>573</span>marks. There is little doubt, then they will show
no undue curiosity.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Penfield made a mistake in punishing Rhoda
for curiosity which was incited by her own method of
dealing with the children.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Enlisting Coöperation</div>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Middleton, instructor in physics in the Rensselaer
Academy, had the freest, man-to-man attitude
toward his pupils of any teacher in the school.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do you do it, Middleton?” one instructor
asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t do it. They do it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Here is the explanation. When Mr. Middleton entered
the laboratory one morning he found that the
little steam engine which he had taken such pains to
fix up had been taken entirely to pieces.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, the fellow who couldn’t see how that engine
worked without pulling it to pieces was pretty dumb.
I worked a good long time in getting the materials collected
for it, and I expect to see it together when I enter
the room tomorrow morning.” This remark was made
in the presence of a number of his pupils. He made
no further allusion to the subject, depending on the
morale of his department to work out the desired
result. He was not disappointed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Rush to Windows</div>

<p class='c007'>When the fire engines rushed by the Shields High
School, as by common consent the pupils rose in their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_574'>574</span>seats and rushed to the east windows, Frederick
Hersey, keeper of the study hour, gasped in amazement
relieved only by the fact that he noticed that
some of his pupils seemed a little hesitant to take
advantage of the excitement.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as the interest waned he said, “You may
now take your seats.” Further than this no comment
was made.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the first opportunity, he asked Laura Blank how
it came about that the pupils of the school rushed to
the windows without permission. After fencing a
short time, she said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Last year our teachers let us watch the engines
and big auto trucks go by and so we just ran to the
windows.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Utilize Class Officers</div>

<p class='c007'>In order to handle the matter speedily and effectively,
after being informed of the facts, the principal
summoned the four class presidents, and gave them
an opportunity to coöperate with him about breaking
up school work out of foolish curiosity.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The school acted like four-year-old children. If
for no other reason than for the sake of discipline in
case of accident, we must try some way to correct this
custom. I want to ask you class presidents if you will
mention the matter at your next meeting and get the
pupils to agree that we shall have no such breaking
away from good order for any reason.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After some parleying back and forth the idea was
adopted by the classes and later put into effect. No
public mention was ever made of the principal’s decision
and attitude on the matter, nor was there need
of any such announcement.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CASES ARISING OUT OF THE EXPRESSIVE INSTINCTS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Deeply ingrained is the impulse to exchange ideas
with other persons. So strong is it that even when not
removed from human associations we often personify
animals and inanimate objects and address the artificial
persons in words expressive of ideas.</p>

<p class='c007'>The expressive instinct has produced a large
number of meaningful human attitudes, actions and
sounds—silence, gesture, signalling, facial expression,
singing, whistling, handclapping and other noises
made by hands and feet. All of these facts have direct
bearing on school discipline. If thoroughly understood
they can be so dealt with as to relieve a teacher
of much anxiety. Otherwise the torments of pandemonium
await the teacher and failure marks attempts
at school work proper.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most comprehensive desire that lies behind
actions of this sort is to gain recognition from other
persons. We shall study the evidence for this conclusion
through a number of instances.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>In General</div>

<p class='c007'>(1) <i>Whispering.</i> A few students of the subject of
school management may need to be reminded that a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_578'>578</span>child who whispers is attempting to conform to a good
school policy and at the same time to satisfy a powerful
instinct. He foregoes the use of the ordinary conversational
tone in deference to the custom or rule
that outlaws the unrestricted use of the same for pupils
in the school-room.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a powerful instinct that impels one to communicate
with his fellows. No one has failed to experience
the impulsion to talk, or in some way, express
himself to another person.</p>

<p class='c007'>The child ordinarily speaks freely and in a normal
tone of voice when addressing another individual.
Whispering is an unusual and emergency measure,
adopted when circumstances render the customary
mode of communication inappropriate, imprudent or
impossible. The interchange of ideas brings a pleasant
glow of good fellowship.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whispering, also, is a relief from the weariness of
work. If there is any daring in a pupil he will try
out the teacher on whispering. There are always
enough reasons why occasional communication is necessary,
to afford an excuse for asking permission to
whisper, and next, to whisper without permission.</p>

<p class='c007'>No teacher ever attempts to secure absolute silence.
Minor infractions of a whispering rule are always
tolerated. Such must ever be the case. These concessions
to human necessity lodge the idea that more
whispering may pass unnoticed. In a word the conditions
that favor whispering are numerous and very
stimulating.</p>

<p class='c007'>The impulse to whispering can never be eradicated
from a pupil. It may be suppressed or directed. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_579'>579</span>wise teacher has no wish to remold human nature to
the extent that a person ceases to care for the opportunity
of talking to another person.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are confronted with the problem of how to control
an impulse that we desire to preserve without
injury and yet without waste of time and effort.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whispering has always been a menace to the best
school order. Everywhere and in all grades it threatens
to retard or make impossible the highest type of
school work. Not only is the noise of whispering a
nuisance in itself, but it stimulates unnecessary noise
from other sources. When whispering ceases many
other sounds of doors, rustling leaves, etc., will be
either markedly subdued or entirely eliminated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Furthermore, whispering is a well recognized cause
of inattention to the subject in hand. The pupil who
whispers, and the one to whom he whispers, both have
their attention withdrawn from the work of the
moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whispering is not a wrong in itself, like dishonesty
or theft. Again, while all agree that better order can
be maintained without whispering, few have a tested
method to suggest for reducing it to a minimum.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most useful principle of discipline for the control
of whispering seems to be that of substitution.
Given a room full of children with no work to do,
whispering will spring up instantly. Given a room
where every pupil has urgent work on hand, the
amount of whispering will be greatly reduced.</p>

<p class='c007'>If work can be substituted for communication, as
an object of interest and effort, a large gain will have
been made.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_580'>580</span>Careful attention must be given to the age of the
offender. In younger pupils the joys of talking with
one’s fellows are still very enchanting. Usually offenders
are not vicious in intention, rather they are
quite without self-control.</p>

<p class='c007'>To require that whispering shall be reduced to a
minimum can not be looked upon as an injustice; at
most it is only an inconvenience. At church and theater
and in the parlor or dining-room, whispering is
tabooed. The teacher, then, is merely requiring what
good manners prescribe in this respect for other assemblages
of people.</p>

<p class='c007'>The whispering problem can never be allowed to
solve itself. The offenders will wax worse and worse
until intolerable conditions will compel a reform. On
the other hand a method of suppressing whispering,
that only interrupts school work the more, is not to be
adopted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most favored procedure is to adopt, first of all,
a general policy regarding quiet, one that is patiently
urged and unceasingly enforced. Sudden, explosive,
distracting attempts at suppression are to be avoided.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every teacher, from the first grade to the last year
in the high school, will admit that whispering is one
of the most general annoyances. Some teachers succeed
in holding it in check while others aggravate the
difficulty until it becomes a misdemeanor.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are educators who recommend that as long
as whispering is carried on about lessons and school
work, it should not be prohibited. There are others
who say it should be prohibited, but fail to give prohibitive
measures. The former fail to note that whispering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_581'>581</span>about lessons and school tasks is really a temptation
to whisper about almost anything that comes
into the child’s mind.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>First Grade</div>

<p class='c007'>In the first grade, whispering about lessons and
school work is unusual. Their interests are play interests
and their activities are the activities of child life;
about these they talk. It is only natural that they
should do so. While it does not seem fair to the child to
transplant him from his outside world of freedom to
the school-room where the privilege of free expression
is denied, still the first grade teacher must bear in
mind that if she allows whispering to become a habit
in the first grade, it will become very annoying in
the higher grades. There is no argument in favor of
whispering, and, therefore, the first grade teacher
should train her pupils not to whisper during the
school sessions.</p>

<p class='c007'>In rural schools the matter of preventing whispering
is more difficult than in the city school, for what is
busy work for one grade cannot be used in another.
What will interest one grade will not interest another,
hence study periods and periods of busy work
must be most carefully planned, especially in the first
three grades. Too much time must not be given to
study, for that means opportunity for play and mischief
and, of course, for whispering.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even with the best planning, an occasional child
will whisper. Such a child should not be reproved in
a faultfinding way. The teacher may preface her request
to refrain from whispering by approval of something
that has been well done, then say, “My dear,
we do not whisper here at all.” Following her request,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_582'>582</span>the teacher may do some kindness for the child that
will gain his love and affection and make him willing
to try to obey the teacher.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the child repeats the offense the teacher must
use the same methods again. Say, “Oh, no. Do not
do that, we must not whisper.” The teacher should
use an even, smooth tone of voice, devoid of the least
inflection that might indicate impatience or unkindness.
She should follow this second command by expectancy.
She should feel that the child will not do
otherwise than obey her. The child may repeat the
offense, but the teacher must use the same method
again and again, until the child responds and does
not whisper. Second and third offenses usually make
teachers impatient, and, instead of kindness and indulgence
toward the child, they manifest impatience.
By all means such a course should be avoided, even
though the offenses be many.</p>

<p class='c007'>Teachers are often heard to complain that pupils
recite before called upon, or talk without permission.
Such teachers confess to faulty methods on their own
part. Early in the year they failed to curb such tendencies,
thereby allowing them to become habits. In
the very first lesson require each pupil to wait for his
turn in the recitation, to secure permission to speak
when he has something to say. If the teacher will
closely supervise her class work in this manner for the
first month, she will have no further trouble on this
point. To begin right is half the battle in school-room
discipline. Those petty offenses that a teacher dislikes
must be prevented the first day, the second, and
so on, until they no longer recur.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_583'>583</span>In the first and second years it is highly important
that the pupils form correct school-room habits in all
respects. Whispering is easier to control here than in
any subsequent grade.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Whispering Habit</div>

<p class='c007'>Carrie, a little girl six years old, was nervous and
talkative. She had a habit of turning her face half
around toward Mabel, who sat just behind her, and,
half covering her mouth with her hand, she would
whisper to Mabel almost constantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the teacher, Miss Bond, was giving general
instructions she was constantly reiterating, “Carrie,
stop talking!” Carrie had a semblance of obedience
in this direction simply because her speeches were
never long.</p>

<p class='c007'>Evidently Miss Bond had no other expectation than
that the offense would be repeated. The work of both
Carrie and Mabel was below par.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Change Carrie’s seat in order to give her new surroundings.
Give her and her classmates something
that is easy to do, and expect them to do it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Use the principle of substitution by changing the
work often. If Carrie whispers in her new location,
talk to her privately about it. Show her your friendship
for her in many ways. Never give up the idea
that she will soon stop whispering. Instead of calling
out to her so that all hear you, go to her privately and
without faultfinding ask her to stop whispering.
Whenever you observe that she is diligent and has refrained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_584'>584</span>from talking for a little while, commend her
warmly. As soon as she realizes that you are her
friend, and that you really expect her to stop whispering
she will do so.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Habit breaking is possible only when a new habit is
being formed in place of the old one. A child will say,
“I just can’t keep from whispering,” telling thus
both a truth and a falsehood. The truth is that when
the external conditions and the inner set of the mind
are both favorable, the habitual act is certain to occur.
The falsehood is that the child “cannot control the
habit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Whispers need oftentimes a decisive shock in order
to shake them loose from an ingrained habit. This
shaking up may be largely self-administered if a
tactful teacher knows how to make a pupil measure
himself and pass judgment on his own behavior.</p>

<p class='c007'>Changing the seat breaks up the complex circumstances
in which whispering has hitherto been practiced.
The removal to a new location creates a mental
shock, yet offers no insult to one’s personal feelings.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is valuable aid in hurrying the mind of a
pupil on from one point to another while establishing
a new set of ideas in the mind. Keeping a pupil busy
following your program by the presentation of new
tasks, duties, recreations, helps to save him from falling
back into the moods that have been the fruitful
source of improper conduct.</p>

<p class='c007'>When dealing with a disciplinary case, a wise administrator
attempts, just as far as possible, to keep a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_585'>585</span>sharp eye on the train of events that transpires in
that pupil’s life. Any serious interruption of the
sequence of ideas and moods that are favorable to
the reform, necessarily postpones the fixation of the
new trait, habit or resolution.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pupils will quickly learn that a firm disciplinary
policy, a helpful watchfulness, can be maintained
without carrying with them an aggravating scrutiny
of conduct. Friendship and good fellowship can be
revealed through teamwork in the building of a character
as well as in the coaching of a football team.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the best chums are those who occupy the
relation of player and coach. When on the athletic
field the coach exercises rigid mandatory control. The
onlooker may suppose that he is something of a tyrant,
but the boys on the team know better; they sense his
genuine good fellowship underneath the harsh exterior.
By common consent the future victory is willingly
bought with the price of undergoing these
strenuous activities under an apparently despotic
supervision.</p>

<p class='c007'>In like manner the school teacher must learn to exercise
a positive control over the activities of a pupil,
which shall not abolish, but covertly disclose, rather,
a fine sense of the comradeship that binds a good
teacher to a responsive pupil.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes out of a spirit of helpfulness a child is
led to whisper when, in reality, the one to whom he
whispers is most at fault, as in the following instance
taken from an experience in the Fourth Grade.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“Helping” by Whispering</div>

<p class='c007'>Lawrence seemed given to constant whispering. The
most trying thing about it was that he seemed to whisper
more constantly while class instruction was going
on than at other times. Miss Blair was the more puzzled
over this because Lawrence was an exceptionally
bright pupil, and very courteous. This matter of whispering
was the only case in which he failed to obey
Miss Blair.</p>

<p class='c007'>When she spoke to him about it he listened respectfully
with flushed face and downcast eyes. He certainly
did not seem indifferent to her wishes, yet
the very next time she began to pronounce words in
spelling he seemed to divide his attention between writing
the words and whispering to Freddie, who sat just
behind him.</p>

<p class='c007'>When she stood near Lawrence, he did not whisper;
furthermore he always seemed to whisper to Freddie
only.</p>

<p class='c007'>She consulted Freddie about changing his seat, but
found him anxious to retain his place behind Lawrence.
She decided that the best plan was to punish Lawrence
as well as others for whispering. So she announced
that five minutes would be deducted from the recess
period of a pupil for every time he whispered.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was surprised to find that this seemed to place
no restraint upon Lawrence. He whispered as much
as ever and lost every recess like a little soldier.</p>

<p class='c007'>When this had been going on for two weeks, one day
Sarah, who sat just behind Freddie, hung around Miss
Blair’s desk plainly trying to get up courage to say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_587'>587</span>something. Finally, Miss Blair said, “What is it,
Sarah?” Sarah replied, “Freddie makes Lawrence
whisper.” Miss Blair said in astonishment, “How
can that be?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why,” said Sarah, “Freddie can’t tell just what
you want, or he can’t spell the words and he punches
Lawrence in the back and Lawrence tells him what to
do or how to spell the words.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Here, then, was the key to the situation, which
Freddie had been too selfish and Lawrence too manly
to disclose.</p>

<p class='c007'>Freddie was given a seat near Miss Blair’s desk
where she could help him, and Lawrence ceased to
whisper. The sadness which had shown in his face
at every recess was replaced by happy relaxation.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Find out by tactful questioning, changing seats during
one period, etc., just why a certain child persists in
whispering. Ascertain whether the one to whom he
whispers gets or gives information and arrange for
the dependent one to get direct help from you, or from
some fellow pupil, after instructions have been given.</p>

<p class='c007'>Never keep a child in at recess time for any other
reason than that he has already had recreation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Test Freddie’s hearing. It may be that some defect
in that respect has made it impossible for him to catch
some of the explanations given by the teacher.</p>

<p class='c007'>If hearing is found to be normal, test his vision.
Possibly he can not see all the lessons that are placed

<p class='c016'>The Bavaria system has revealed the great need of
individual instruction. This question of getting help
on the difficult parts of a lesson is not, in itself, wrong.
The evil comes from the confusion of haphazard whispering.
The whispered help which one pupil gives
another, without the teacher’s consent, is attended by
more than one evil. The attention of two pupils is
shifted from the central interest. The teacher is deceived
as to the real knowledge which the helped one
has of the subject and he can not therefore correctly
estimate his work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet the physical well-being of a child demands
that he have his recess period of relaxation. The
teacher who does her duty in the matter of supervised
play will abandon “keeping children in” as a
punishment for misdemeanors.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Rewarding with Stars</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Green tried the following method in her room.
She wrote the pupils’ names on the blackboard in a
conspicuous place. She told the children that whenever
she saw a child whisper during the week just
beginning she would erase his name.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the beginning of the second week a star was
placed after each name remaining on the board. Those
who had whispered the week before were given another
chance by again writing their names on the blackboard.
Each succeeding week a new star was given
to those who had not yet whispered and each week
those who failed were given a new trial. When any
one had received six stars they were given a book.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_589'>589</span>Little was said about those who failed, but every week
a story was told, when the stars were given, showing
the value of self-control, or the disaster which followed
lack of self-control. This plan practically eliminated
whispering.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 105 (FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADES)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Outdoing the Teacher</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Peterson taught the fifth and sixth grades in a
central Illinois town. She had a loud, scolding voice.
The children whispered almost incessantly, apparently
to drown her harsh tones. They nearly always succeeded
in part, but occasionally when the noise of
whispering seemed worse, Miss Peterson’s voice actually
arose above the din and in threatening tones she
said to them, “Stop whispering!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Her evident reason for this was to get only a temporary,
partial silence, for this was all she accomplished.
Her outbreak against noise occurred two or
three times daily. The children even blew whistles
very softly at times and actually disliked Miss Peterson
the more because she seemed to believe them when
they told her the sound was made by the wind whistling
through the cracks around the ill-fitted windows.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day when the noise seemed worse than usual, she
announced that whoever whispered next would have to
“stand on the floor.” There was a moment’s silence
and then one of the girls whispered a comment upon
her remark. Instantly Miss Peterson called her to
stand up in the front of the room. The girl to whom
she whispered immediately talked for the obvious purpose
of joining her friend in disgrace. When Miss
Peterson asked the second girl to join the first, a smile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_590'>590</span>was exchanged between them. This was seen by others
who decided to join in the fun. One after another,
almost as fast as named, joyfully joined the group of
those standing, and what is more, whispered to each
other on the floor. When almost half of the pupils had
been called out, poor Miss Peterson gave them a very
angry lecture, and threatened them with the loss of
recess. A partial silence ensued after the lecture,
but that session of the school was worse than lost.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Take time to see yourself at work in the school-room.
Test out your own influence as a noise maker by
adopting some very quiet methods of doing your own
work; see if the children do not imitate you also in
maintaining better order.</p>

<p class='c007'>Abandon the haphazard method of curbing whispering.
Think the whole situation over; measure each
pupil in respect to the whispering nuisance; classify
the room as a whole in respect to the matter. Probably
you will adopt two or three methods simultaneously
for different types of pupils.</p>

<p class='c007'>Apply these methods unobtrusively. By working
with individuals have the rumor pass around that you
are becoming stern about whispering. This can be
done without provoking enmity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Use a number of stories on self-control, neighborliness,
etc., but do not connect them with your campaign
against whispering. If some story makes a great hit,
allude to its leading character when dealing with certain
individual offenders.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_591'>591</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>A harsh voice or a loud tone tends very strongly to
provoke school-room noise. It sets an example; it
shows the teacher’s disregard of the customary rule
relative to quiet in the room; it provokes a similar
noisiness for the sake of self-defense.</p>

<p class='c007'>The well modulated voice not only pleases sensitive
ears and gentle spirits, but it suggests strongly to the
pupils what their own voices may be like. Such a
voice says not only, “Do this,” but also “Do it
quietly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The voices of most persons are untrained. Teachers
usually give little professional attention to their voices,
yet no aspect of their personality needs greater
attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>The voice is usually a good indicator of character.
Miss Peterson doubtless is no exception. We doubt if
any person enjoys her friendship as much as if she
used a sweeter, gentler, lower-pitched voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The adoption of some method of voice culture will
react on the character.</p>

<p class='c007'>Either singing or dramatics will soften the voice and
warm up the heart. If nothing else is available, the
reading of well selected poetry with an attempt at
faithful expression has a lasting effect if maintained
for a considerable period.</p>

<p class='c007'>Public announcement of a mode of punishment for
a certain offense often leads a group to try together the
experiment of breaking the rule laid down. A public
talk about a general misdemeanor must be well
thought out and given at an opportune time, with no
hint of anger on the part of the teacher. The pupils
<span class='pageno' id='Page_592'>592</span>will not reason that an angry person’s judgment is
warped, but they will nevertheless, resent a lecture
given in any other than a seriously helpful attitude of
mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>The novice and the failing teacher use direct methods
hoping to secure immediate and adequate results. One
teacher says, “I want to use a method that will bring
whispering to a stop at once.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Human nature rarely consents to such radical
methods. Indirect methods and a little lapse of time
are usually necessary to give the human nervous organism
opportunity for readjustment. Such a reorganization
of habits is not closely under the control
of the will; rather the lower nerve centers must actually
effect the desired reforms. Intelligent choice
merely supplies the inner stimulus which directs the
course of the rebuilding of habit that is so earnestly
longed for.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The perpetual ill-behavior of many children is
itself the consequence of that chronic irritation in
which they are kept by bad management.... That
harsh treatment which children of the same family
inflict on each other is often, in great measure, reflex
of the harsh treatment they receive from adults.”

<p class='c016'>Mrs. Steward taught a room of pupils in the fifth

she felt that she had the confidence of her pupils and
could count upon their coöperation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Taking a Vote</div>

<p class='c007'>On Friday morning just before recess she said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_593'>593</span>“How many of you would like to try to have no whispering
at all between now and recess time? It is only
ten minutes.” A majority of the children voted that
the trial be made. The silence was really restful.
Just before dismissing for recess she asked how many
liked the silence. Again a majority of them held up
their hands. About twenty minutes before noon she
again allowed them to vote as to whether or not all
should refrain from whispering until noon. This time
more even than before voted for silence. Half an hour
before school closed they again decided against whispering
for the rest of the day.</p>

<p class='c007'>On Monday one or two sessions were voted upon
with success. Before the end of the third week the
children from choice had voted whispering out of the
school for the rest of the term because they liked complete
silence better.</p>

<p class='c007'>They followed the teacher who used the method of
leading suggestion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thereafter when someone forgot and whispered, they
were reminded, kindly, that they were not following
the wish of their fellow-pupils. On this subject of
majority rule, stories were told of its value in human
history.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many teachers make use of the honor system in
determining deportment grades, especially asking for
self-reporting on whispering and similar offenses.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 106 (RURAL SCHOOL)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Boling taught in a rural school in Central Illinois.
He used the following system as a check upon
whispering.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>When All Whisper</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_594'>594</span>Every evening just before school closed he called
the roll. Those who had not whispered during the
day were to answer “ten.” If they had whispered
once “nine.” For every time they whispered during
the day they were to deduct one from their daily
grade in deportment.</p>

<p class='c007'>With some children this acted as an effective check.
One little girl, Jennie, had truthfully answered “ten”
every day since the introduction of the system. She
sat with her sister in a double seat. One day a friend
asked permission to “speak” and came to the sister’s
desk to borrow a book. Jennie not being able to find
the book said to her sister, “Look on your side!” Then
she slapped her hand on her mouth and her little
heart sank. She had broken her record. She had
whispered without permission! Many notes passed
between the sisters as to whether or not Jennie had
really whispered without permission. It was grimly
decided that she had. They reasoned that whereas
the friend’s permission to “speak” allowed each of
them to speak to her, still that gave the sisters
no right to speak to each other. Jennie suffered all
the rest of that day. How like a real culprit she felt
when she answered “nine” at roll call. The memory
of the disgrace lingers with her through the years.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Mr. Boling had other pupils of far different
home training and natural disposition from Jennie.</p>

<p class='c007'>Katie Mender and Annie Kuhn were examples of
this class. They whispered almost incessantly. Jennie
knew it and she believed Mr. Boling himself knew
it and yet they answered “eight,” “nine” or “ten”
every evening.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_595'>595</span>A few there were who not only whispered incessantly
but who shamelessly answered “zero” every
evening.</p>

<p class='c007'>Clifton with a good-natured grin answered “zero”
daily and looked around the room with a complacency
that seemed to say, “What a smart boy am I!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And even Jennie often wondered if his care-free life
was not enviable. Nothing was ever said or done by
Mr. Boling to show that Jennie was more to be commended
than Clifton.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Commend Jennie for her conscientious reports. Talk
privately to Katie and Annie about their false statements.
Make them see the value of truth in business
and social life.</p>

<p class='c007'>This may be done publicly at roll call by some such
statement as this: “Every day that Jennie makes a
true report of perfect control of her desire to whisper,
she has grown stronger in character as surely as the
oak is stronger after battling with a wind storm.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A reference to the growth of flowers would please
Jennie but would not impress the boys. Give them some
such instruction as this: “Notice carefully every thing
you say during one play period. Stop to think what
would have happened if you had been untruthful every
time you spoke. When you have thought of a good
reason why people should speak the truth come and
tell me what your reason is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Have a further check upon Clifton, one that he will
respect. His is a case of ignoring wholly the rights of
others. You may say, “Clifton, what would you do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_596'>596</span>if a new boy should come to school and wish to play
ball. Then when playing he wouldn’t heed a single
rule of the game. Suppose he insisted upon striking
as long as he pleased, tripped those on his side when
they ran, and never helped to get his opponents out.
If the boys were sure he knew just what to do, how
would they proceed?” Clifton will tell you that they
wouldn’t let him play. “Would they like him?”
“Why?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Take another case. Say, “Suppose a twelve-year-old
boy came to school who talked out loud continually
and so spoiled the game of studying and reciting
lessons. What ought I to do?” He will doubtless suggest
a course to stop the boy’s talking. “Now supposing
a boy whispers all the time and so hinders
others as well as himself from scoring a point in their
favor in arithmetic or spelling, what should be done?”
“But in all these cases it would be better to hold on
to the boy, don’t you think?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lead him thus to see the case in its true light. If
Clifton does not weigh matters when you talk them
over with him, separate him from the mass of the
pupils. This can be done without inflicting an intentional
penalty. See this method as developed in the
illustration just below.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>If Jennie is not commended, she will have no reason
to believe that her honesty and restraint are really
valued.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a shameful neglect on the part of a teacher to
allow children to lie habitually and do nothing to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_597'>597</span>them truthful. Mr. Boling, to lessen a minor wrong,
tolerated a gross misdeed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Clifton was daily learning anarchy, and demonstrating
to the school that lawlessness is regarded as
“smart” by some. This idea should be speedily
corrected.</p>

<p class='c007'>In place of the honor system which invariably has
the three classes of dispositions above described to
deal with, a better plan is isolation.</p>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Seats Near the Front</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Taylor of Allenton used this method to reduce
the amount of whispering. She arranged a seat on
each side of the room near the front for the use of
those who needed special help in the matter of self-control
necessary to prevent whispering. Since every
desk was occupied she placed a sewing table against
the wall on either side in front for desks, and used
camp chairs for seats. At these tables she allowed
children to sit who needed an environmental help in
securing self-control. She made it very clear that this
was not punishment; it was simply help to enable the
child to do what he himself wanted to accomplish.
Her whole attitude was that of solicitude for the best
welfare of the two who had the additional help of
isolation to teach them self-control. Those who occupied
these seats were aided by giving them helpful surroundings
in place of those fraught with temptation.</p>

<p class='c007'>When pupils have reached the high school age, if
former training has failed to give them enough self-control
to make them refrain from whispering at least
<span class='pageno' id='Page_598'>598</span>they will be able to see the reasonableness of silence in
both the study and recitation rooms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here special honors and privileges may well be
granted to those who are silent if only the teacher
makes it clear that a reward for the exercise of self-control
is just as legitimate as a diploma for courses
in study completed. Indeed a badge of honor won
through self-imposed restriction in this matter is an
index of real merit, and the tactful teacher can easily
show the pupil that this is the case.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much of the trouble about whispering here, as in the
grades, arises from pure thoughtlessness, selfishness or
self-esteem.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Displaying Wit</div>

<p class='c007'>In the Elkton High School many factors contributed
to make Charles Drover a favorite. He was an athletic
star, he was from a popular family, but above all he
was a wit of considerable merit. His witticisms always
secured a hearing. His temptation to whisper was
very great. Remarks of general import, no matter
how serious, usually ended by giving those around
Charles much to do to refrain from laughing aloud.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Hodge, the high school Principal, was annoyed
past endurance. One morning after a brief talk on a
coming lecture, Laura, a neighbor to Charles, smiled
broadly. Mr. Hodge said, “Laura, pass into my
office.” She went at once. After the classes had
passed, Mr. Hodge went to his office and frowningly
explained to Laura how much her constant levity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_599'>599</span>annoyed him and demanded that she bring in extra
school work as punishment, and further said that if
she still persisted in treating all remarks made from
the platform with so much unconcern he would see
to it that no position of trust be given her in high
school affairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The week passed and the day of the lecture arrived.
Laura was to be one of the ushers that night. Mr.
Hodge was giving some final directions concerning
the arrangements for the evening when Laura giggled.
Instantly Mr. Hodge announced that some one else
must be appointed in Laura’s place as usher and that
she bring in the translation of twenty extra lines of
Caesar the following day. This was the beginning of a
strong opposition to Mr. Hodge which culminated in
his being asked to resign at the end of the year.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Deal with the cause of the disturbance. Suppression
of either the laughter of the girl or the humorous trait
in the boy is entirely out of the question. Pass over
the girl’s misdemeanor until the boy has been disposed
of.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cultivate the humor in Charles. The primary task
will be to teach him how to make good use of his talent.
Wide reading under your direction will acquaint him
with many types of humor and enable him to choose
with discrimination. Show him the appropriate uses
of humor, the occasions when humor can best be indulged
in, the injuries wrought by unregulated fun.
Have him take charge of the humorous column in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_600'>600</span>high school weekly. If he has a gift in drawing,
develop humor and art together.</p>

<p class='c007'>You may learn a great deal from Charles; if you do,
let him know the fact and so link him to you the closer.
Hold many private chats with him informally about
his work and enter into it with genuine interest.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Nine times out of ten the one who laughs in school
is not the real culprit. A person scarcely ever regards
himself as “funny” or ridiculous. A pupil laughs at
another’s error, blunder or joke.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the sense of humor is enkindled, laughter is the
only natural outcome; the control of one’s impulse
to laugh must of course be taught, yet for school-room
purposes it is far more important to be master of the
conditions that provoke laughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The treatment recommended for Charles will help
to make a man of him, and other pupils will respect
the teacher all the more if he prizes a talent which
wins the applause of all the school.</p>

<p class='c007'>A teacher who is unable to laugh or to share in that
which is positively humorous is an unlovely person.</p>

<p class='c006'>“’Twas the saying of an ancient sage that humor
was the only test of gravity, and gravity of humor.
For a subject that would not bear raillery was suspicious;

immensely, for laughing together makes hearts warm
up towards each other.</p>

<p class='c007'>The weak teacher dares not risk himself to laugh
when the class or room is seized by a fit of fun. For
the pupils it is highly interesting to watch the struggles
of the teacher to avoid doing that which they know
he likely wants to do. In refusing to participate in
their mood he repels them. He puts himself out of
their group; he takes a position as a critic and as an
alien.</p>

<p class='c007'>If one leads pupils to make proper use of their
talents, he fulfills his truest function as an educator.
Developing, restraining from excesses, guiding in the
profitable use of the natural endowments of the child—these
are the necessary duties of every high-minded
instructor.</p>

<p class='c007'>We must learn that the impartation of school facts
is but one means of equipping a child for taking his
place as a prepared member of society.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whatever natural gifts a child has must be dealt
with in school life. Those that are dormant must be
drawn out; those that are already functioning must
be directed.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Jennie Leavitt was a high-strung, irrepressible, well-meaning
girl far on in her teens. It was her custom
to announce firm adherence to good moral standards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_602'>602</span>when such matters were up for discussion. Her motives,
moreover, were seldom open to question.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Isolating Whisperers</div>

<p class='c007'>She entered class at the opening of the term with
an established whispering habit. Her classmates, one
by one, were moved from her vicinity so that, finally,
only one was left with whom she could chat. Her
breaches of good order were so innocent that any suggestion
of coercion seemed inappropriate; the removal
of her companions reduced the problem to small
dimensions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The teacher had but one short step to take: to give
her remaining companion another seat in some unobtrusive
way and to make enough assignments of written
work to afford a means of expression for the active
mind of the school girl. This could easily be done
because of the excellent mutual understanding between
the whisperer and her teacher.</p>

<p class='c007'>A school should offer conditions and surroundings
that are as conducive as possible to study, to concentration
of the pupil’s effort. Too many teachers put
plenty of emphasis on the physical factors in their
pupils’ surroundings—ventilation, posture, light, etc.—but
allow their rooms to degenerate into a perfect
hubbub of noisy confusion in which study is impossible.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 108 (FOURTH GRADE)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Joseph Levy and Sadie Higgins, two pupils in the
fourth grade of the Pittsburgh Avenue School, Minneapolis,
were talking without permission, when Miss
Bowen, who was conducting an arithmetic lesson on
the other side of the room, saw them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Talking Without Permission</div>

<p class='c007'>“Joseph and Sadie! Did anyone give you permission
<span class='pageno' id='Page_603'>603</span>to talk?” she inquired. “I want you all to know
(she rose from her seat and addressed the whole
room) that hereafter there is to be no talking without
permission. If it is absolutely necessary that you
speak to someone, hold up your hand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The next day Sadie “forgot.” Miss Bowen was busy
helping another pupil. She waited until she had finished.
In the meantime, several minutes had passed.
Sadie had found out what she wanted and was working
on her arithmetic lesson, when Miss Bowen went
over to Sadie’s desk, pulled her out of the seat by her
arm, and said so the whole room could hear, “Sadie
Higgins, I’m not going to tell you more than once that
you have to ask permission when you want to speak.
Do you hear me?... Well, sit down and see that the
next time you wish to speak, you ask my consent before
doing so.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Discuss matters of conduct with offenders, not with
non-offenders. Because Sadie had spoken without permission,
it is not therefore necessary to tell Joseph that
he may not speak without permission. Address yourself
to the one who needs the prohibition. Treat each
case by itself. Wait until you have finished your immediate
work, whether it is holding a recitation or writing
on the blackboard. When the period is ended, quietly
speak to Sadie in private, telling her she must ask
permission when she wants to speak as you may be
able to answer her question without bothering another
pupil.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just hold up your hand and if I think it is necessary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_604'>604</span>I shall nod my head, meaning ‘Yes’; this will
not disturb the rest of the room.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

than any talking between Sadie and Joseph did when
she called the attention of the other pupils to the fact

<p class='c007'>Every teacher should remember that children need
constantly to be reminded of what they should do
until the act becomes a habit. Miss Bowen did Sadie
an injustice, since the child had not been accustomed
to ask permission when she wished to speak.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was very well for Miss Bowen to wait until she
had finished the work at hand before speaking to Sadie,
but she should have remembered that the child had had
time to forget that she had spoken. To pull her out
of her seat and publicly scold her was entirely out of
place.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Breaking An Old Habit</div>

<p class='c007'>When Miss Lucas took charge of the fifth grade
room in the Henry Clay Grammar School, Lexington,
Kentucky, she was informed on the first day that the
children were accustomed to speak to one another
without permission. As this was often annoying, especially
when three or four spoke at once, she decided
that this must not be.</p>

<p class='c007'>When, the following morning, she saw Lola Mossman,
a girl of exquisite manner, walk over to the desk
of Bernice Bryant, evidently to ask her about a lesson,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_605'>605</span>Miss Lucas waited until the close of the period, when
she spoke to Lola in private.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is it the custom in this school, Lola, for the pupils
to speak to one another during a study period without
permission?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Miss Lucas.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am sure the whole room will be less disturbed
if we form the habit of asking permission before we
speak.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you need to find out something about a lesson,
you should have permission to speak. I will willingly
grant it; but do not ask to speak when you see someone
else talking. It is disturbing to the other pupils to
have two persons speaking at a time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Through Lola Mossman and one or two other pupils
as a medium, the children soon discovered that Miss
Lucas expected them to ask permission before speaking.</p>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Monopolizing Time</div>

<p class='c007'>Mamie Eggleston was a devoted pupil in the fifth
grade of a school in Paterson, New Jersey. She never
missed an opportunity to talk with Miss Olmstead, her
teacher, before or after school.</p>

<p class='c007'>“May I come in?” Mamie would say if she saw Miss
Olmstead seated at her desk before school began.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, indeed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then for fifteen minutes Mamie would talk just for
the sake of saying something to someone who would
listen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I like Miss Forsyth’s new waist, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are those little black bands on your wrists tied or
fastened on? That waist is awfully becoming to you.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_606'>606</span>I have a pink waist. My mother made it for me. But
she won’t let me wear it to school,” etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s the bell,” Miss Olmstead would say as she
thought, “Well, there’s another fifteen minutes lost
and I intended to put the arithmetic problems on the
board before school began.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Do not over-indulge a talkative child. In a kind but
firm way tell her that you have some important work
to do or that you must see Miss Belmont before school
begins. If she persists in talking with you after school,
answer her questions politely but hurriedly, while you
put on your wraps and say as you go out of the room,
“I have to leave now. Are you ready to go home?”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Olmstead did an injustice to both the child
and herself. Valuable time was wasted by allowing the
child to talk on at length, without any motive other
than the pleasure of talking.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not necessary to cut off entirely a child’s talking
with you outside of school hours. Such pleasant
associations between teacher and pupil are to be encouraged.
We are concerned in this case with the child
who likes to talk just to keep herself in the foreground.</p>

<p class='c007'>By heeding only those questions which have weight,
by listening to the child’s talk only long enough to be
polite, you will help her to control a desire which,
unrestrained, will, in the future, make her presence
unbearable.</p>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Reforming Habits</div>

<p class='c007'>When Miss Carleton first came to teach in the sixth
grade in East Orange, New Jersey, she was warned
that certain little girls in her room had the habit of
talking to the teacher whenever they could get an
opportunity. They enjoyed loitering around the
teacher whose place Miss Carleton had taken, because
they thought it was her duty to listen to everything
they had to say. As a consequence, they literally ruled
the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Kimball says&#160;...” and “Miss Kimball says&#160;...” they would remark as if they were the appointed
interpreters of Miss Kimball.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Carleton made an immediate decision that she
would show the children by her actions that she did
not intend to waste valuable time listening to their
empty talk.</p>

<p class='c007'>As usually happens with a new teacher, she was surrounded
by a group of girl leaders at the close of the
first session.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you bring your lunch, Miss Carleton?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you know our room is going to give a set of
books to the library this year?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That will be lovely,” Miss Carleton politely replied
to the last question, as the first one had been immediately
superseded by the second.</p>

<p class='c007'>She then stood to arrange her desk in a businesslike
manner, implying that the present moment offered
no opportunity for further discussion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Immediately she went to her wardrobe, saying as she
did so, “I take it for granted you all brought your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_608'>608</span>lunches. I hope you will enjoy them. You might
move the waste basket a little nearer your desks so
that it will be convenient for your papers and fruit
skins.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When I come back from lunch I shall expect to see
each one of you out in the school yard. It is a beautiful
day for a game of Hop Scotch.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So Miss Carleton tactfully mastered the situation
of the first day.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 110 (SIXTH GRADE)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Atkinson was an intelligent, quick, good-natured
little woman whom the children really liked.
She never got angry, and her discipline was good so
far as the big misdemeanors were concerned.</p>

<p class='c007'>The A division was reciting its arithmetic lesson
while the B division studied. Miss Atkinson sent half
of her class to the board and started to give out an
example.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Talking During Recitation</div>

<p class='c007'>“May I find out the lesson from Tom?” A boy who
had been absent the day before was speaking, without
pausing to raise his hand for permission.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Atkinson nodded and read the example over
again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We had that example yesterday,” came from one
of the pupils in the class.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, we didn’t. It was something like it but it
wasn’t the same,” replied another.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before the dispute was settled and the children at
work, five minutes of the recitation period had been
wasted. Ten minutes later, Alice, of the B division,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_609'>609</span>asked if she might open a window. Then Grace wanted
to borrow a pencil. While Miss Atkinson was showing
Joe how to point off, Henry called out, “How many
places must we carry it out?” By the time the various
queries were answered, Joe’s attention had wandered
and in order to make his difficulty clear to him,
the teacher had to go back over the ground already
covered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus every class period was frittered away. Questions
were continually being fired at the teacher like
shots out of a gun. One bold pupil was constantly
making remarks intended to be funny or to delay the
progress of lessons. Miss Atkinson could not see the
harm in answering the seemingly legitimate inquiries,
and her efforts to curb the general habit of talking
aloud were altogether too mild.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fully one-half of both the children’s and the teacher’s
time was wasted by such interruptions. Serious,
concentrated effort was impossible and the duller
pupils were confused and distracted by this endless
breaking into their train of thought.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Insist that the work in hand shall not be interrupted.
If for one day the teacher will persistently refuse to
recognize questions spoken aloud without permission,
a long step will have been taken in the direction of
correcting the bad habit.</p>

<p class='c007'>Allow two or three minutes between classes, if necessary,
for answering the questions of the division
which has been studying.</p>

<p class='c007'>Henry should be led to raise his hand if he needs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_610'>610</span>help, and his difficulty should be settled in turn—after
Joe’s has been explained. The bold pupil would lose
some of his smartness if he were fully occupied with
work. Keeping the pupils constantly busy in the arithmetic
class, by dictating rapidly and putting a premium
upon getting through quickly, prevents discussions
upon unessential parts of the work, such as
whether or not the same example had been given out
before; the children do not have time to consider the
matter.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>It is not difficult to make children see that the rights
of others are infringed by interruptions such as speaking
aloud without permission. Once this is understood,
the teacher must stick to her refusal to recognize such
interruptions. When the children understand that
they are expected to keep silent, they form the habit
of waiting for permission before asking questions.
Unless the teacher shows respect for the lesson in
hand—not allowing her attention to be distracted from
it—she can not expect the pupils to do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some teachers are afraid to refuse to answer questions
at the time they arise in the child’s mind, fearing
to bring the child to a standstill in his work and that
he will be idle unless his difficulty is settled. It is a
part of a child’s education to learn to be independent,
to solve his own difficulties. Too much dependence on
“Teacher” unfits the pupil for progress in his lessons
or in anything else.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_611'>611</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (SIXTH GRADE)</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The habit of talking aloud is easily cured.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Ellis was called upon to substitute in the place
of a teacher who had been lax in her discipline. The
pupils talked aloud almost as freely as if they had been
in their own homes. Miss Ellis knew her position as
substitute would be a hard one, and made up her mind
that she would spend the first day, if necessary, doing
nothing but enforcing order.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Making Up Time</div>

<p class='c007'>The first time a child talked out loud without permission,
she said, quietly, “Now, John, you know we
can’t get very far with this lesson if we are to be interrupted.
And we don’t want to have to take it over
again tomorrow. Suppose you try to settle the matter
yourself, or wait until after this class to ask me.”
And she did not answer John’s question.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was only a few minutes until Isabel remarked that
she couldn’t see what was written on the blackboard
from where she sat. Miss Ellis told Isabel that by
standing up she could read what was written there
very plainly, and that it was unfair to the rest of the
school for her to take up their time by speaking aloud.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the third interruption Miss Ellis said, again very
quietly, “At this rate we shall all have to stay after
school today to finish our work. I will not answer any
more questions until this class is over. Then I will
give you three minutes to do all the speaking, borrowing,
and so forth that is necessary for the rest of
the morning. And any talking aloud will put us just
five minutes behind with our work, so we’ll have to
make up that five minutes after school.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_612'>612</span>No one went home that afternoon until an hour and
a half after the regular time for dismissal, but the talking
aloud habit was broken, once and for all, during
Miss Ellis’ regime.</p>

<p class='c007'>One big element in a teacher’s control of a school is
a phase of stick-to-it-iveness, namely, her ability not
only to prescribe a given line of action but to stick to
it herself and hold her pupils to it day after day. Too
many teachers are spasmodic in their control. They
are very strict for a few days, then grow negligently
lax in their discipline, only to pull their pupils up to
the previous standard again with a jerk. It is just as
easy to form good habits as bad ones, but a teacher can
never hope to train a school in good habits if she punishes
today what she leaves unnoticed tomorrow, as
Miss Rand, a seventh grade teacher, did.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 111 (SEVENTH GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Useless Talking</div>

<p class='c007'>It was Friday afternoon and both teacher and pupils
were weary of the school-room and of work; all were
a little cross and nervous, and impatient for the dismissal
bell to ring.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Make John quit tying my hair-ribbon to the inkwell,”
spoke up a girl from the back of the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before John’s case was quite settled, “May I erase
the boards after school?” “Does our geography lesson
begin on page 268 or 267?” “Do we have to write
our compositions in ink?” and so forth—an endless
string of useless questions, confusing to those who were
trying to study and nerve-racking to the teacher. And
besides the talking aloud there was a constant and
needless passing to and fro.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_613'>613</span>“Now see here, children, this has got to stop. Monday
morning we’re going to turn over a new leaf and
put a stop to this talking aloud. Remember that!
The first one who talks or leaves his seat without permission
will be punished.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Monday morning, true to her word, Miss Rand punished
every child who talked aloud without permission.
Tuesday and Wednesday the school was a model of
quiet and order. But Thursday Miss Rand had a headache
and did not feel quite equal to having it out with
Theodore when he asked, without permission, “Is this
the 22nd of the month?” for it was a perfectly legitimate
inquiry, inspired by the exercise in letter-writing
which was his language lesson.</p>

<p class='c007'>A half hour later Margaret called Miss Rand’s attention
to the fact that the clock had stopped, then
looked scared as she realized she had broken the rule.
Miss Rand argued to herself that the child meant
well, so she let the talking aloud pass uncommented
upon.</p>

<p class='c007'>And so it went, the children falling rapidly back
into their old habit of talking whenever they pleased.
By the middle of the next week pandemonium was
again the order of the day and Miss Rand again
“cleaned house,” saying, “Tomorrow morning I’m
going to begin making everyone of you who talks aloud
stay in at recess. There is no reason why you can’t do
your work quietly, and tend to your business without
asking so many questions,” and for a few days she was
most energetic in enforcing quiet and order.</p>

<p class='c007'>But in two weeks the school-room was again a place
of noisy confusion. And so it went.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_614'>614</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Instead of announcing, each time, that there would
be a change in her way of running the school, Miss
Rand should have said, “Don’t talk aloud without
permission, Theodore,” the first time and then, without
saying any more about it, she should have quietly
signified by a gesture or a look that speaking aloud was
forbidden, refusing to answer queries put in this fashion.
If she had done this <i>every</i> time a pupil spoke
aloud and had never let a single opportunity to correct
this bad habit go by, the school would always have run
as smoothly and as well as it did for the few days after
one of her periodic upheavals of enforcing order.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have backbone enough to stick to the course of
action which you know to be the best, in spite of the
fact that you are tired and that four o’clock is almost
at hand. All you need to do is to raise your hand in
a gesture enforcing silence, but do it every time talking
aloud occurs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The effect of quiet insistence upon the no-talking
rule is much better than a hundred spells of violent
housecleaning, with periods of laxness in between.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>A school can not run smoothly and be governed well
if the authority of the teacher has to be constantly
brought into view. It is the unseen authority which
counts for the most.</p>

<p class='c007'>A teacher who is consistent, and who makes her
pupils understand that she means what she says <i>always</i>—not
just temporarily—gains their respect and confidence.
She can govern them then without the prop
<span class='pageno' id='Page_615'>615</span>of punishment or rewards, because they feel her
strength and continuity of purpose—her ability to
govern.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Work Steadily</div>

<p class='c007'>A certain young man who owned a fine colt undertook
to break him himself, although he had had no
experience in training horses. The colt was high-spirited
and difficult to control, the young man impatient
and nervous. When the colt did not do as he
was expected to <i>immediately</i>, the young man was apt
to lose his temper and use the lash pretty roughly.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day an experienced horseman watched such a
performance from across the street. The young man
gave the colt several beatings in succession, the horse
becoming more and more difficult to handle all the
while. After the horseman had watched a long time in
silence, he called to the colt’s owner, “Put up your
whip, young man, and hold the lines tight and steady
and you will find that your colt will act differently.”
The young man acted upon the suggestion and found
that he could claim immediate success.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 112 (SEVENTH GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Too Great Absorption</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Bersley was a teacher in the fourth grade of
a school in Brockton, Maine. She was an enthusiastic
young woman, but there was one great drawback to
her teaching. She became so interested in what she
was saying, that she gave the backward pupils in her
room no chance to recite. They were too slow. She
was always sure of a quick reply from such children
<span class='pageno' id='Page_616'>616</span>as Spencer Thorpe. He was ever ready to speak on
every subject, even though he was not always informed.
Miss Bersley would not have openly admitted
this to be the situation, but her recitations disclosed
her attitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Name the principal manufacturing towns in New
England.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Up went Spencer’s hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Bersley hesitated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Spencer flung his arm around until she said, “All
right! Spencer, since you are so anxious to recite,
you may tell us.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Once on his feet, he named one town after another,
as fast as they came into his mind, regardless of
whether they were manufacturing towns or whether
they were located in New England.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What natural advantages does New England have
for manufacturing?”</p>

<p class='c007'>As usual, Spencer raised his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well, Spencer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So, through over thirty minutes recitation, out of a
class of thirty-five, Spencer Thorpe was called upon
five times, while many less forward pupils were given
no opportunity for self-expression.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>At the beginning of the geography recitation say,
“I am going to try a new plan in the lesson today.
Let us see if I can tell who knows his lessons by the way
he looks instead of by the raising of his hand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Be sure to give as many of the children an opportunity
to recite as you can—all if possible.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_617'>617</span>At the beginning of the next recitation say, “The
plan we tried yesterday worked so well, I believe we
will try it for the whole day.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>By calling on all or nearly all of the pupils, you
will accustom the boy who wants to speak all the time,
to the idea that he must take his turn with the others.</p>

<p class='c007'>By substituting an intelligent interest in the recitation
for the raising of hands and the mere pleasure
of being the central figure in the class, you will raise
the class standard to a higher level. By assuming an
attitude of attention, the pupils will unconsciously
become interested in each other’s recitations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The teacher may not hope entirely to do away in a
day with the excessive raising of hands, or of speaking
without waiting to be called upon, but the fact that
she has secured her point during one recitation makes
it easier the next time to suppress the excessive desire,
on the part of one or two pupils, to monopolize the
time and attention of the class to the exclusion and
detriment of others.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (EIGHTH GRADE)</h4>

<p class='c016'>At the beginning of the class in United States history

she was going to do away with the privilege which

<div class='sidenote'>Refuse Answers</div>

<p class='c007'>“We have so many points to cover in the recitation

promptly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Deaton smiled. Her attitude was one of complete
confidence. The class responded accordingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just once during the recitation did George Mills,
the class “speaker,” forget. Miss Deaton had only
to raise her eyebrows to remind him that this was not
the form to be followed that day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Laxness on the part of the teacher, even in a seemingly
trifling matter, sometimes destroys the order in a
school-room for all time. To get the best results and
to make the most progress in school work, there must
be no leaks in the efficiency tank. The experience of
a certain eighth grade teacher proves this to be true.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 113 (EIGHTH GRADE)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss James was a strict teacher who kept her word
and was both feared and respected by her pupils.
Technically she was a good teacher, too; that is, she
knew how to present a subject to the child mind, to
organize and emphasize the vital points in a lesson.
There was apparently no reason why the children of
the eighth grade room should not accomplish as much
as the individual ability of each child would permit.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Interrupting the Studious</div>

<p class='c007'>But they were not doing it. Mildred, who had gotten
averages of 90 in most subjects throughout the seventh
grade, was hovering just above the passing mark. The
same was true to a lesser degree of others, and there
was a continuous effort on the part of Miss James,
the teacher, to suppress small naughtinesses in children
who had good records for previous years.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_619'>619</span>The children never finished tasks in the time assigned
and the work done was mediocre in quality.
Miss James did not realize how badly things were
going until Mildred’s mother presented the case to
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was just after the monthly issue of report cards.
Mildred’s card showed some unusually low marks—one
that was far below passing grade. Mildred was
a conscientious girl and could not herself understand
why she failed to do as good work as she had done the
year before. She knew she worked hard but she never
seemed to accomplish results. Things always managed
to happen just so that she had to skip over the last
few paragraphs of her history lesson in a hurry, and
look up all her reading words at recess because she
had no other time to spend on them.</p>

<p class='c007'>When she showed her card to her mother, bitter
tears of hurt pride were in her eyes, for in the past
there had never been anything but commendation at
home when she brought home her month’s record.
Her mother, being a wise woman, drew her little
daughter to her and asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the matter, dear? Father and I know you
don’t waste your time at school. There must be a
reason for these low marks. Is it that Miss James is
unfair? Doesn’t she give you what you deserve to
get?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” sobbed Mildred. “It isn’t that. She marks
higher than Miss Johnson did last year. I really
don’t deserve to get any more than this. I do well
enough on tests when I can study up, but I don’t do
good work every day.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_620'>620</span>And Mildred cried out her trouble in her mother’s
arms. That lady resolved to visit Miss James the next
day and have a serious talk with her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss James had seen that the eighth grade was
doing uncommonly poor work and had cast about in
her mind for the reason. She had shortened lessons
until she was in danger of not complying with the
schedule, and she had watched with an eagle eye for
inattention and laziness. When Mildred’s mother
pointed out the contrast between this year’s and last
year’s work she was forced to admit that Mildred
was always busy and was by no means a dull pupil.</p>

<p class='c007'>What was the trouble?</p>

<p class='c007'>She decided to watch more closely than before the
events in her school-room.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next morning after opening exercises were over,
her glance over the room showed her every head bent
over a book. The room was so quiet that Robert
Woods’ wheezy breathing (he had a very bad cold)
was distinctly audible.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the stillness was broken by John. He saw
Miss James looking at him and asked a question about
the lesson. Most of the children looked up from their
work, shifted their positions, or gave some other evidence
of having noticed the break. In a few minutes
someone else asked permission to leave the room. And
so on through the period.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not until she had watched for several periods did
Miss James realize the stir each one of these speeches
aloud made, and how frequent they were. Then she
saw that the speaking aloud disease had reached an
advanced stage in her school-room and that it, and it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_621'>621</span>alone, was responsible for the seemingly causeless deterioration
in her pupils’ work.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Do not sit still in the front of the room during a
study period and let children ask questions whenever
they please. Require them to raise their hands and
then go to them and settle the difficulty quietly without
disturbing the rest of the school.</p>

<p class='c007'>Develop the social consciousness in the child as early
as possible. Make him realize that, for the general
welfare of the whole school, it is worth his while to
forego satisfying his need immediately.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>In this case the teacher was a good one and a good
disciplinarian, but one minor weakness in her fabric
of control had undermined all the rest of her good
work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Work, no matter how earnest it may be, can not be
constantly interrupted without suffering the consequences.
The inspiration is gone and interest flags.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fullest and best work of which children are
capable can never be finished on time if it is accomplished
under the stress of interruptions and distracted
attention. A steady noise, even a clatter or
roar, does not disturb a worker after he becomes accustomed
to it. It is the occasional outburst, the
sudden breaking in upon a silence, that confuses the
mind.</p>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Exhausted Nerves</div>

<p class='c007'>A young engineer who was accustomed to working
in a downtown office in a big city was transferred to
a branch office in a small town. In the city he had
been surrounded by the continuous clatter of typewriters
and adding-machines, the noise of the traffic
in the street below and the boom of elevated trains
just outside the window. Because these sounds were
steady and relatively constant, the man did not notice
them. He paid no heed, though his work required
intense concentration and uninterrupted thought.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the small town branch office he was the sole occupant
of a little room looking out upon an uncleared
field. Shortly after the engineer’s arrival the owner
of the adjacent land began to clear it. He used dynamite
to blast out the stumps. The explosions of the
blasts would have been lost in the din to which this
man had been accustomed in the city, but breaking in
upon a dead silence as they did, they annoyed the engineer
so much that he lost much time trying to pick
up the broken threads of his work every day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, these noisy explosions began to get on his
nerves, for he was a high-strung man. At the end
of two weeks he had a nervous breakdown which was
caused by nothing but these periodic disturbances
that set his nerves on edge and shattered his self-control.
Fortunately, by the time he had recovered
from his illness, the blasting was finished and he went
on with his work undisturbed.</p>

  <h4 class='c015'>CASE 114 (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>When Miss Barton had charge of the high school
assembly room in Geneva, Illinois, it was always a time
for unlimited privilege on the part of the pupils.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miss Barton, may I speak to Elsie?” Susan
Emmons asked, without raising her hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two blonde heads were soon together talking over
what they were going to wear to Jeannette’s party.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two minutes later: “Please, may I speak?” This
was from a demure-looking girl who was never known
to ask this privilege from any other teacher.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several minutes passed without a reply from Miss
Barton. She was enjoying some peace in reading her
home newspaper when again, “Miss Barton, may I
speak to Susan?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes” (said without thinking).</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, when Elsie was on her way to speak to Susan,
she recalled, “Didn’t I just give you permission?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, you gave Susan permission to speak to me.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Too Frequent Speaking</div>

<p class='c007'>“All right.” Miss Barton sighed as she turned her
attention to another part of the room, where two boys
were amusing themselves looking out of the window.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Refuse, without discussion, a request to speak, when
you know it is not necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is often wise to ask, when such a request is made,
“Is it necessary?” Look into the child’s eyes as you
say this, letting him see by your attitude that you do
not intend to give the permission unless it is necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>One cautious teacher asks, “Is it something about
your lessons?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_624'>624</span>Refuse all requests that have nothing to do with
the pupil’s work. Limit the time for speaking. Do
not allow more than one person to speak at a time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much speaking can be avoided frequently by quietly
stepping forward to the person who asks the permission
and saying, “Can I help you? We won’t disturb
Susan if we can help it.” The implied suggestion is
itself a reminder to be more careful about asking such
favors.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you make it clear when you first take charge of
a study room that you expect little or no whispering,
the pupils will soon find out that such “speaking” is
quite unnecessary.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>In the case of Miss Barton, the pupils misused a
privilege which should have been reserved for special
circumstances only.</p>

<p class='c007'>The study period is not a time for idleness or recreation
on the part of the teacher. If she makes it so,
she can not blame the pupils for following her example.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Herrick had charge of the study hall in the
Pittsfield High School the last period of every day.
Her presence meant “Study.” There was no time
for foolishness when she came into the room. She
treated requests to speak in such a chary manner that
a pupil would think twice before asking the privilege.</p>

<p class='c007'>“May I speak?”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Learn the Reason</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Herrick would not say a word, but would
beckon the pupil to her desk.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_625'>625</span>“What would you like to learn, Jessie?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wanted to ask Mary how to do an algebra
problem.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bring your book up to the desk; perhaps I can
help you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So time after time a request to speak to a fellow
pupil was turned aside for something more helpful.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) <i>Studying aloud.</i> Probably few teachers realize
the difficulty a child meets in learning to suppress
tone and muscular movement of mouth and lips while
reading. Indeed, the adult can assure himself that in
silent reading, even he does not suppress all movement
of tongue and vocal cords.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 115 (THIRD GRADE)</h4>

<p class='c016'>When Miss Smedley took charge of the third grade
in the Russell Sage School, she had to meet several new
situations, one of which was most annoying. Almon
Metcalf insisted on studying aloud. Most of the pupils
in the room were accustomed to this, as he had been
in the same room with them for years.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Studying Aloud</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Smedley was conducting a class in arithmetic
in the upper division, when she heard a monotonous
mumbling on the other side of the room. Almon
Metcalf was studying his reading lesson.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Almon, I wish you would study silently. Don’t
you know you are interrupting our arithmetic lesson?”</p>

<p class='c007'>All the children then turned around to look at
Almon.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again she started to take up the lesson, but the
children’s attention was all on Almon. Miss Smedley’s
patience was taxed to the utmost. It was hard enough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_626'>626</span>to pound two times two into the minds of children
when they were interested, but to have their attention
distracted by a boy who insisted upon studying out
loud—this was too much.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Almon Metcalf, come here!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The scared little boy hesitantly walked up to the
front of the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aren’t you ashamed to take up my time this way?”
Miss Smedley shook him while the rest of the room
looked on the scene with greatest interest.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Give the boy an isolated seat for the time being.
When with him alone apply a test whereby you can
find out the cause of his studying out loud. Take a
second grade reader and pick out a simple paragraph:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Almon, read this paragraph to yourself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>If you discover he can not tell you what he has read
when he has finished the paragraph, teach him how to
read silently. This matter of <i>teaching</i> silent reading
is a point neglected by a great number of teachers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Take one short sentence from the second reader.
Read it to yourself, first, so that he can watch you.
Then ask him to read the sentence the same way.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What did you read?”</p>

<p class='c007'>If he answers correctly, say, “That’s right. Now
read two sentences.” If he can not tell you what he
has read, give him a simpler sentence. Do not give
up the test until he is able to read <i>something</i>, no
matter how easy the sentence may have to be.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the following day give the whole class the same
test. Select a somewhat more difficult sentence. Let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_627'>627</span>the one who can first give the words orally, raise his
hand. Make a game of silent reading and its difficulties
will soon disappear.</p>

<p class='c007'>With third grade children, the teacher should show
her class how to study each lesson. It is not enough
to give an assignment. The method of study should
be outlined.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the preparation of the reading lesson, for instance
(for that is the subject in which a child is more
likely to study aloud), put a list of the most difficult
words on the board and mark them for pronunciation.
Ask the class to examine the words. Then say, “Are
there any words you can not pronounce?” Give special
attention to the boy who studies aloud, asking
him to pronounce the words which you have written
on the board.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the fourth and upper grades, place a list of
the more difficult words on the board, the meaning
of which the children should be asked to look up in
their small dictionaries; and do not forget that children
have to be taught how to use the dictionary.
Have play drills in this as in all other difficulties of
a mechanical sort.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Smedley did not stop to figure out why Almon
Metcalf studied aloud. If she had, she would have
taken into consideration the fact that he had been
two years in school without being taught how to study.
She would have realized that calling the attention of
the whole room to his deficiency would not help him
to break the habit.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_628'>628</span>The boy was not the only one who was to blame for
distracting the attention of the class in arithmetic.
Miss Smedley’s own remarks were instrumental here.</p>

<p class='c007'>Almon Metcalf needed Miss Smedley’s special guidance
in learning how to study.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (FIFTH GRADE)</h4>

<p class='c016'>When Rosa Bentley entered the fifth grade of the
Lowell school, Miss Sieger recognized her at once as
an inveterate talker. This was especially manifest in
the study periods where Rosa had formed the habit
of studying aloud.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Teach Silent Study</div>

<p class='c007'>“Well, there must be some cause for the child’s
doing this,” thought Miss Sieger. “She is another one
of those untrained pupils.” Miss Sieger was aware
of the deficiencies in our school system.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m going to teach Rosa how to study.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That afternoon she worked alone with the child for
fifteen minutes, patiently helping her, sentence by
sentence, to comprehend what she was reading without
pronouncing the words aloud. This was only the beginning
of a series of special lessons in how to study.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Rosa had gained some headway, Miss Sieger
held her up as an example to an occasional delinquent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rosa has learned how to study, now can’t you?”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 116 (SEVENTH GRADE)</h4>

<p class='c016'>In Miss Algernon’s seventh grade room there were
three pupils who insisted on studying aloud.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Studying Aloud</div>

<p class='c007'>“I should think that by the time you reached the
seventh grade, John Leavitt, you would know how to
study. Only babies in the second and third grades
<span class='pageno' id='Page_629'>629</span>have to study aloud. I don’t know what our schools
are coming to when they allow pupils to be promoted
to the seventh grade who have never learned how to
study. I can not see that there is much use of your
being here.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Suppose you go down into Miss Kreisler’s room
this morning and learn how to study. Her little third
grade pupils know more about studying than you do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At the same time, Miss Kreisler was telling her
children, “Miss Algernon is going to send three of
her seventh grade pupils down here this morning, because
they have been disturbing her whole room by
studying aloud. I want you to show them that you
can study silently.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She had no more than finished her statement, when
three children, John, and Farry Lawrence and Ellery
Comstock, came into the room with all the assurance
that such a conspicuous position could give them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may take those three vacant seats,” said Miss
Kreisler, as she mustered all the self-control she had
to keep from laughing. The situation was so incongruous.</p>

<p class='c007'>The little children caught the spirit and a general
giggle rose in the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>It did not take Miss Kreisler many minutes to see
the futility of such a corrective measure. She sent
word to Miss Algernon: “The plan didn’t work. You’ll
have to try something better.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Give a sample lesson of the situation as it would be
if everyone in the room studied aloud.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_630'>630</span>“Let’s try it. Take your geographies. Don’t be
afraid. Read aloud, everyone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That will do.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did it seem? Do you think we can afford to
study that way? We couldn’t get much done, could
we?</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right; let us remember to have consideration
for others in the room when we are studying.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think that list of questions on the board will
help you in preparing your geography lesson for today.
You will find the answers on pages fourteen to
seventeen.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>It did not help the children who had never learned
how to study, to be held up in ridicule before a third
grade room, nor to be cited as the product of a poor
school system. Miss Algernon gave the children the
impression they were the ones at fault and, what was
even less excusable, that there was little hope for them
in school. This would hardly inspire them with courage
for greater effort.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (EIGHTH GRADE)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Griffin, a teacher in the eighth grade of the
Waller Avenue School, decided to cure two boys in
her room who had the idea they could not study in
school unless they spoke aloud.</p>

<p class='c007'>During a study period in which she was at leisure
she went quietly to each boy’s desk and privately
asked:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_631'>631</span>“Are you a Chinese boy, Leonard?” The boy
laughed and shook his head.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Chinese Method</div>

<p class='c007'>“I thought not. Well, do you know, Leonard, that
Chinese boys study out loud? A Chinese boy learns
his lessons by shouting aloud until he has committed
the passage to memory. Then he hands his book to
the teacher, turns his back and recites the lesson as
fast as he can.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, you are not a Chinese, Leonard, neither are
we advertising the old Chinese method of education.
Let me see you study like an American boy hereafter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>(4) <i>Tattling.</i> The tale-bearer usually acts to satisfy
some secret desire either for fame or for revenge.
Tale-bearing grows directly out of the taproot of
selfishness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fortunately, public opinion, both in school and out
is sufficient to suppress the majority of pupils in their
leanings in this direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless, a few individuals now and then taste
the sweets of tale-bearing. These are apt to be in the
lower grades, where the force of community ideas
has less weight.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the sake of both teacher and pupil it is necessary
to mark a clear distinction between the legitimate
report of a misdeed that is a menace to good order and
the petty, selfish carrying of stories of other pupils’
misdemeanors.</p>

<p class='c007'>The difference is marked by the character of the
motive and the frequency of the reporting.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some supervisors and administrators take the unwarranted
position that all reporting of misbehavior
by pupils is wrong. They do not expect nor desire information
<span class='pageno' id='Page_632'>632</span>of misbehavior to come to them from pupil
sources. They highly commend all pupils who refuse
to answer questions on the misconduct of their schoolmates.
They deny that the best of motives can warrant
a revelation of student wrongs to the school
authorities.</p>

<p class='c007'>This position is extreme. It seems due to an attempt
to adopt a pupil’s point of view. It positively
contradicts the duty laid down by public sentiment
and the fundamental law of the land, to the effect that
all good citizens must aid in the discovery and repression
of crime.</p>

<p class='c007'>A pupil stands in a double position. He owes good
will both to his comrades as individuals and to the
school as an institution. His duty to neither must be
overlooked. The rule of right in the case seems to be
somewhat as follows: to his schoolmates he owes a
generous silence when their misdeeds are not a serious
menace to the school and a kindly sympathy when he
must report their wrong actions. To the school he
owes a loyalty that requires only a reporting of that
which if left untold will be a serious injury to both
the wrong-doer and to the school.</p>

<p class='c007'>These broad statements need careful application in
particular instances. For example, to answer the
questions of an administrator should never be construed
as tattling. To relate daily that Charley has
been dropping hints of his intention to give Robert a
sound thrashing should not be approved under the
head of school loyalty; it stands on the level of gossip.</p>

<p class='c007'>Teachers will do well to weigh carefully the attitudes
of the conscientious and the over-conscientious pupils
<span class='pageno' id='Page_633'>633</span>of their schools. The sense of duty to their schoolmates
and to their teachers sometimes leads them into
embarrassing dilemmas. A rough and ready rudeness
with them will mark the dull and hardened teacher,
who may foster a strained abhorrence of tale-bearing.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the daily experience of the school-room it will be
found that tattling usually arises from a distinctly
selfish impulse. Perhaps jealousy is the most usual
inciting cause. At times there is a standing antagonism
between two pupils; the hope of revenge is here
the leading impulse to tale-bearing. In other instances
mere acquaintance, with neither friendship or antipathy,
is to be observed; the eagerness for a sensation
such as seeing a boy or girl whipped may lead to
reporting minor or major wrongs.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>First Grade</div>

<p class='c007'>The little child who comes to school and tells the
teacher and his playmates all the happenings of the
home is as annoying as the pupil that is constantly
coming to the teacher to tell that a certain pupil did
this or that, or, in common school language, tattles.
While a few teachers cultivate this practice in pupils,
it is right to brand it as one of the most ignoble of
habits. Teacher and pupils can be no better off for
knowing all that goes on in a certain home. The
teacher should tactfully talk of something else—something
so interesting as to divert him from his talk
about home matters.</p>

<p class='c007'>The habit of tattling or “telling on” other pupils
is more annoying and usually gets the pupil who indulges
in the habit into ill-repute with the other pupils.
It must be admitted that the teacher sometimes needs
information from a pupil or pupils to ferret out some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_634'>634</span>misdemeanor. But this should be given only when
the teacher asks for it. In the first grade it is almost
an exception if the teacher needs to ask pupils to give
information to explain some misdemeanor. If the
teacher pays no attention to tattling, it will soon stop.
The spirit of tattling can be effectively cured, if, when
the child tells on a certain pupil, the teacher will turn
to the child and ask him if he does not admire some
particular trait in the other child.</p>

<p class='c007'>Often the motive for tattling is envy. By asking
something about the other child’s good traits, envy
will be eradicated, and it will be the exception if the
offense is repeated.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 117 (SECOND GRADE)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Daisy was a talkative child. Her eyes went everywhere
and her ears picked up all the news that passed
her way.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“Telling on” the Pupils</div>

<p class='c007'>“Teacher, Tommy’s whispering”—“Jennie lost her
book”—“Philip said some bad words”—“Annie’s
papa’s dead, and she says she don’t care.” After a
few interruptions of this sort, her teacher broke out
with:</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you don’t shut up, I shall go crazy. Why don’t
you go to work and leave other people’s affairs alone?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Such a rebuke closed up the torrent of tattling for
only a very few minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next string of remarks was cut off with, “Not
another word from you this morning. You’re a regular
little tattle-tale.” When another remark began
it was blocked by:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can’t hear any more tales from you today.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_635'>635</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Substitute some suitable form of expression for this
excessive tale-bearing. Even an eager interruption of
the child, when you discern the trend of her remarks,
is entirely in order. In particular try to find food
for her mental hunger in the novel and sensational
matters of her daily school life. Make immediate
offers of help in her school work, in place of patient
attention to tales. Polite ignoring of the child’s chatter
will ultimately induce her to cease; especially if
you suggest your disapproval of her unkind remarks
by saying: “I like to hear good things about people,”
or “Haven’t you something pleasant to tell me today?”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>No doubt the little tale-bearer often conveys useful
information. If the teacher discloses any satisfaction
with these tales, she may aggravate the very ill she
should endeavor to cure. Any gains from tattling,
should be used with great caution.</p>

<p class='c007'>The general attitude of indifference and unconcern
is the best antidote for tattling. When a story-teller
loses his audience, all the impulses to talk are quieted;
he necessarily runs down. A dignified reserve and a
continuous distraction from the disagreeable habit
will be a certain remedy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Ignore Remarks</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Moffit, recently at the Endwood rural school,
had the art of drawing out her pupils’ confidence on
a variety of topics. They discussed school work, flower
<span class='pageno' id='Page_636'>636</span>gardens, dress-making, electrical devices, corn contests,
and a wide range of topics. This freedom of intercourse
spurred the tattlers also into action. Hilliard
came up at frequent intervals with numerous, personal
incidents, until he learned how to control his tongue.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Some of the boys are taking home chalk in their
pockets.” At another time, “Sallie’s eating in school
time,” or “Minnie didn’t get her problems.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Moffit sensed the drift of Hilliard’s mind. She
decided to become absolutely impervious to Hilliard’s
tales. She took the lead in conversations when he approached;
she switched from one topic to another so
rapidly that he had no opportunity to make much of
his fund of anecdotes. She gratified his impulse to
talk, by asking him questions on themes in which he
was interested.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tattling to the teacher lost its charm for Miss Moffit’s
pupils.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 118 (THIRD GRADE)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Marvel Green was one of the innumerable throng
of schoolboy caricaturists. With periodic certainty
he spread his drawings before pupil eyes for his own
glory.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“Who Drew the Picture?”</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Hatfield knew Earl Moss, another mischief-maker,
so well that she turned to him when she discovered
a new “Green” on the blackboard and in an
official manner, asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you draw that picture of me over there?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No I did not,” was Earl’s quick reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who did it then; I’m sure you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I won’t tell, Miss Hatfield.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_637'>637</span>“You must tell me now. I’ll punish you if you
don’t.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Good sense came to her rescue and she postponed
action until there was time for reflection.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the evening the boy’s father called and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I understand that you are going to punish my
boy if he does not tell who drew the picture. Now
I came to say that I can’t agree to that. I don’t
want my boy to do wrong, but I can’t allow him to
be punished for refusing to be a tattler. You must
find some other way out of it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” thought Miss Hatfield, “he has a strange
idea. I don’t want to make a tattler out of his boy.
He’s a queer one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She didn’t whip the boy, and she never learned
who drew the picture.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Silently erase the picture, or better still, pay no
attention to it, if it is not a serious disturbance to
school work. At all events make no public attempt
to find out the artist. Many teachers would refuse
to question one who did a given wrong, as it is almost
certain to lead to complications. If your hold on
the school is strong, laugh off the matter and say:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know where to find a good salary for a competent
cartoonist. If any of you are interested, let
me know.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>General opinion is divided on the matter of tattling
on a schoolmate. Blue law moralists demand that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_638'>638</span>every child and every adult freely tell all they know
against a fellow pupil.</p>

<p class='c007'>The majority of persons may be trusted to oppose
breaking down clan loyalty among pupils to the
degree that any pupil shall be expected to tell of
another’s fault when requested to do so by a teacher.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wise teacher manages to avoid raising this
issue as he nearly always loses in the contest. It is
proper, of course, to ask a class to accept responsibility
for a known prank.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (FIFTH GRADE)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Superintendent Alexander was loaded with the responsibility
of bringing an end to a series of petty
thefts in a fifth grade room. The teacher laid the
matter before him, in a manner which showed her
extreme annoyance. He calmed her by saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Leave it to me. I have long said there are no
‘bad boys’ and I believe it yet.” Mr. Alexander continues
his story:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“Who Stole?”</div>

<p class='c007'>“The boys knew before this that I would play fair
with them. The first time I met two or three of the
fifth grade boys individually, I let them know that I
was aware something was wrong in their room, but
made no charges nor inquiries. There was good reason
to believe that several boys were involved in the
pranks. By falling in with the boys they began giving
me bits of stories about what had been stolen
and when. In a few days I was able to piece up
accounts of three serious robberies. I called together
four boys who, I was morally certain, were guilty.
I said:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_639'>639</span>“‘I want you fellows to straighten up some little
matters that need your attention.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘What matters?’ one of the boys inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘You know as well as I,’ said I.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I paused a moment and told the three stories
quickly. I did not insist on anything further but
promptly dismissed them. Within three days full
confessions were made to me individually and restitution
was accomplished in two cases.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Personal influence is a powerful and a dangerous
force. Sometimes children indulge in character-warping
conduct in the hope of winning the personal
favor of a beloved teacher.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 119 (FIFTH GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Desiring Approval</div>

<p class='c007'>Sigrid Holderson was a pale, timid, anæmic child,
who never joined the other children in their play,
and one whom the other children seemed instinctively
to dislike. When she was in the fifth grade she conceived
a blind adoration for her teacher, Miss Field.
She brought her votive offerings of wilted flowers
and specked apples, all her limited resources afforded;
and she watched for chances to prove her
devotion by running errands and cleaning erasers.</p>

<p class='c007'>One noon she came in with flushed cheeks and
handed Miss Field a crumpled piece of paper containing
a list of names.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All those kids was sliding on the bank where you
told them not to,” she announced. “I took down
every kid’s name that went down.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Field had the usual horror of “tattling.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, you little tattler, you!” she said. “Go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_640'>640</span>right to your seat, Sigrid, and don’t ever do such a
thing again! You must never tattle unless it is
necessary.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sigrid’s humiliation was complete. Her adored
teacher had rejected her choicest offering, the paper
whose writing had been done with stiff, cold fingers
to an accompaniment of jibes from the lawless sliders.
Her little mind could not quite fathom why Miss
Field did not approve her deed, but seemed instead
to take sides with the disobedient pupils.</p>

<p class='c007'>This rebuff cured Sigrid of tattling, but the cure
was worse than the disease. When Miss Field deserted
her, Sigrid felt she had lost her last friend.
Her classmates heaped scorn upon her as a “tattle-cat”;
she withdrew more and more into herself, and
became more and more abnormally sensitive.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>When a child tells on his classmates, he is usually
either over-conscientious or out of sympathy with
them. Miss Field might quietly have accepted the
paper, and thus have avoided increasing the estrangement
between Sigrid and her classmates. She should
then have set about finding the cause of Sigrid’s isolation,
and devised ways of making her one of the
group. She should have known that Sigrid’s pitiful
paper was a bid for the approbation and love which
her isolation denied her; it was the blind feeling for
common ground with another human being, which
Sigrid missed because her relations with the other children
were not healthful.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_641'>641</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>It is usually the out-of-the-set child who tattles;
when his relations with the set are normal, he will not
practice tale-bearing. Tattling which grows out of
pure love of mischief or pure malevolence is very
rare.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Visiting Poolroom</div>

<p class='c007'>Several boys from the London eighth grade were
reported to be frequenting the poolroom. The question
was who planned and led the fellows in breaking
the school rules and the State laws.</p>

<p class='c007'>The teacher easily ascertained that three particular
boys were in the company, but there were others and
the chief offender was not yet named.</p>

<p class='c007'>Superintendent McMadsen took hold of the situation.
He met the three boys and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now we are not planning any sort of punishment,
even though the law permits it. We want everybody
to speak frankly and talk the matter over freely.
You boys are old enough to be summoned as witnesses
and made to tell who was with you in the poolroom.
But that isn’t the best way.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The proper thing to do is for you and me to come
to an agreement as to what we should do about this
matter in the future. Then I want you to tell the
other boys also to come to me and talk the matter
out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The matter lay for a week before the last boy appeared.
The talks were brief, but the moral victory
of individual action on the issue was worth the
patient delay.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ben Sawyer and some of the boys sat just behind
us girls and said, ‘Say, girls, let’s steal out and take
a joy ride like that some night.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, Portio, what did you let him talk to you for?
Never repeat anything such a boy says. I think it’s
ridiculous the way girls and boys talk nowadays.
I simply don’t want to hear of any such foolish
going-on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Portia took her teacher at her word. She told her
nothing of what the boys said to the girls after that.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>In your abhorrence of tattling, do not permit yourself
to lose an opportunity to safeguard an inexperienced
girl. Say to Portia, “How did the girls
answer the question? Were any of them tempted
to do such an unwise thing?” Lead Portia on in
the conversation until you discover her own attitude
toward the right or wrong of indulging herself in
such forbidden pleasures. Leave her finally with a
strong suggestion in favor of right conduct firmly
lodged in her mind. You may say in closing, “You
will do all you can do, won’t you, to prevent
any of the girls from thoughtlessly entering into engagements
which they may regret all their lives?
Can’t you girls plan some way to make the boys
understand that you have too much self-respect even
to be amused at such proposals? It will be a good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_643'>643</span>lesson for the boys as well. Apparently they have
not a very high opinion of the girls.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Anthony, by her own shortsightedness, robbed
Portia of a teacher’s wisdom and counsel, and herself
of a chance to gain insight into the social dangers
of her pupils. Even if Portia does not specially
need counsel at the present moment, she is liable at
any time to have her scruples overruled by the
stronger combined influence of the social group of
which she is a member. Besides, Portia’s good influence
with the group may be greater than your own.
She reaches them directly, you only indirectly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two boys in a wild chase dashed in at the front
door, turned to the left and crashed into a show-case
belonging to a historical exhibit.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ward school principal went to the seventh

<p class='c007'>“Who smashed that show-case?” No one answered.
Then roll call was ordered and each pupil
questioned, “Did you break the show-case?” This

<p class='c007'>The child related her experience at home in order to
lighten the load of her troubles.</p>

right. But they shouldn’t compel answers. What

<p class='c016'>Instead of this farce the principal of this ward school
could make this announcement:</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is customary in this school for pupils to make
good the damage done in a case like this. If the cost
of repairs is too large for them they may come to the
office anyway and we will hit upon some plan of getting
around the difficulty.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now I know that seventh graders are responsible
for this accident. I have traced that down to a certainty.
But I don’t want to know who actually smashed
the case. Please order Mr. Selfredge, the hardware
man, to make the repairs, and then you settle for the
expense and that will end the matter according to the
standards of gentlemen.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>A teacher has no right to put a child into the predicament
of choosing between two conflicting moral codes
without explaining the situation and giving due
thought to the pupil’s viewpoint. Parents will rightly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_646'>646</span>affirm that a teacher is tactless and incompetent who
runs his pupils up into a corner on the matter of
tattling.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, how strong is the appreciation
of the teacher or principal who gives opportunity for
a dignified moral choice! The appeal to manhood or
womanhood never fails to draw forth a response. In
some pupils the response is insufficient, but when a
wise disciplinarian makes such an appeal he almost
invariably gets the desired results.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (SEVENTH GRADE)</h4>

<p class='c016'>A drawing teacher appeared in a seventh grade room
twice a week. It came her turn to suffer from a school
prank—pepper scattered on the floor produced an
uncontrollable epidemic of sneezing.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was not the least clue to the offender, but
the teacher was too proud to thrust the matter into
other hands, so she made this announcement:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can see very well that this sort of thing is
intolerable. We must see that no one reports this. I
want to ask the seventh grade to hold a special class

how.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The superintendent was notified of the plan, consented
to it, and in fact waited with interest to see
who was made chairman of the meeting. To his
dismay the neatest scamp of the forty pupils was
made chairman. After the superintendent retired,
the chairman with great dignity shut and locked
the door, and put the key in his pocket just in time
to prevent the departure of two timid souls.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_647'>647</span>For an hour and a half the conference continued

<p class='c007'>The celebration of the decision of the school board
to erect a new building caused the Culpeper High
School principal no little anxiety. The bonfire was
built on the schoolgrounds, it was started without
permission and some property belonging to the neighbors
was destroyed—three serious offenses. Mr.
Peters called in the senior class and said to each
member privately.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you witness the bonfire? Did you help build
it?” There was no previous agreement, yet each
pupil kept totally silent as to the information desired.
Their only reply was:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Our class did it but I can’t say who.” As a consequence,
hours of time were wasted and strained
relations existed between pupils and teachers. Saddest
of all there was no positive lesson in good discipline.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>A better method is to let the matter rest so far as
the class as a whole is concerned. In a casual way,
say to the class president:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The bonfire built by the senior class involved some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_648'>648</span>little expense for material. I have an itemized
list of the articles destroyed and what seems to be
a just estimate of value. I’ll turn it over to you for
adjustment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I want to ask you to present this question to the
class at your regular meeting next Friday: ‘Shall we
secure permission hereafter when we want to have a
bonfire?’ The answer is ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ I want the
answer, if you please, at the close of your meeting.
I say this because the board of education insists that
I bring word to them of your action.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>The stories of student escapades of by-gone days
have left a reputation that later pupils must live
down. In fact, the pranks of today are, on the whole,
not so serious as those of the past, although teachers
many times are over-anxious about student conduct.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is safe to assume that there is no criminality in
the ordinary public school pupil. By treating the
breach of decorum of school rules as, in a way, accidental,
the actual restraint of pupils from serious
excesses is much more certain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The opportunity of passing upon the nature of a misdeed
in school is a most valuable one, in view of the
larger need of private judgment of community activities
which is required of every citizen. Teachers
are in the wrong when they demand that every prominent
act of disobedience shall be referred to them
for final action. The natural right of private judgment
is defended by the usual horror of tattling.
Consequently, a teacher who sees all these facts will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_649'>649</span>guard against infringement of pupils’ rights at this
point.</p>

down toward town. Her flight was a triumph

<p class='c007'>Si Jones returned late in the afternoon, hunted

see her? Nearly everybody else did. And she’s

not to do it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>During the conversation several hints cropped out
and Si knew enough to start his campaign.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several of the boys came around in groups, but
Jones kept his own counsel, gathering items all the
while.</p>

<p class='c007'>Days later he met Charles alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have been waiting for you to talk to me, Charles,
about my Jersey cow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We didn’t mean to have your cow get away,
Mr. Jones.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I’m spending ten dollars on repairs. I’ve
decided to tear this old fence down and build a better

will give me a lift on this job, I’ll be mighty glad
to have it. If you’ll do that, we’ll call it square.”</p>

afternoon and we’ll be there when you come home.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>First Grade</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_651'>651</span>(5) <i>Swearing and vile language.</i> Swearing or
the use of offensive and vulgar language can be very
troublesome among even small children. One boy
who swears or uses bad language can teach an entire
school to do the same. In homes where such language
is employed, the children will use it away from
home, and unfortunately, in unguarded moments, will
use it on the school grounds or in play and other
activities. At the outset the teacher must learn that
in such instances she cannot effect a cure. All she
can do is to prevent it on the school grounds and in
school. There is but one way to do that, namely, to
supervise all activities at the school.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, a child that comes from a home
where the use of offensive language is prohibited, is
easily controlled. Close supervision will usually eliminate
the practice at school. If the teacher’s attitude
coincides with that of the home, the difficulty is easily
overcome.</p>

<p class='c007'>She can not hope to cure all children who indulge
in swearing, but many will heed her admonitions, and
if she uses all her influence against swearing and
vulgar language and supervises her pupils in all their
activities, she has done her duty.</p>

<p class='c007'>(6) <i>Obstructed expression—Stammering and stuttering.</i>
Stuttering is not a misdemeanor, neither are
such characteristics of a child as awkwardness, slowness,
or some slight deformity. However, the other
pupils often are thoughtless and make fun of the
child that stutters or who in some other way is unlike
his playmates, until he can do no work satisfactorily
and perhaps, finally, stops school. Thus, whatever is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_652'>652</span>done to help the child will lessen the necessity of
disciplining other pupils.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>First Grade</div>

<p class='c007'>Although stuttering is not an immoral act, it is a
very trying difficulty when it presents itself to the
teacher in the first grade. It is known that stuttering
is due to an improper control of certain muscles,
and that anything which excites or draws attention
to the afflicted child will cause him to stutter more
than usual. It is in the first grade that the habit
becomes exaggerated; that is, a child that stutters
very little when he enters school may have the difficulty
intensified during his first year in school.
This is due to the large amount of attention given
to the child by the other pupils and by the teacher.</p>

<p class='c007'>The very first caution for the teacher is positively
to pay no apparent attention at all to a child’s stuttering.
If a teacher can do this, it will have a marked
effect upon the other pupils in making them pay less
heed to it and in due time they will become accustomed
to the peculiarity and not notice it at all. If
other children are inclined to laugh or tease, the
teacher should remain serious and the attention of the
children should immediately be directed to another
pupil whom she will call upon to recite.</p>

<p class='c007'>A stuttering child must have plenty of exercise and
fresh air. He should not be required to sit too long
in school. In the middle of the sessions, the teacher,
may ask him to get her something from out-of-doors
or have an arrangement with him that he may leave
the room at a certain time each day and return in
so many minutes. The latter is not so good a plan,
and if used, must be used carefully.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_653'>653</span>The second requirement for a child that stutters
is a good physical condition: that means, he must
have good food and clothing. This the teacher cannot
provide, but she can be the means by which the child
may secure the same. No parents surely are so
thoughtless regarding the welfare of their children
that they will not join a teacher in effecting a cure
for stuttering. The teacher can explain the methods
she intends to use and then ask the parents to see
that the child has good food and clothing and is kept
in a good physical condition. If a teacher can cure
the stuttering of a first grade child, she is accomplishing
a good for his entire life; one that will win life-long
gratitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>The teacher must guard the child against exciting
situations, especially those in which he must say something.
Under such conditions he would certainly
stutter. He can be allowed to enter into exciting
games providing he will not need to talk. The teacher
as much as possible should cut short the conversation
which is likely to cause stuttering.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is quite necessary that the teacher should watch
very closely to see that the child gets no chance to
indulge in lengthy conversations. Whenever the
teacher talks with him,—and the teacher should
talk often with a stuttering child,—she should conduct
her part of the conversation in such a way that
it will require only short responses from the child.
Even then, if he should begin to stutter, the teacher
should repeat the response with him to the close of
the sentence, and then drop the conversation. A
child that stutters will often succeed in speaking a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_654'>654</span>sentence if someone else repeats the sentence with
him. The teacher can do much effective work with
the child by thus repeating with him the replies he
wishes to make.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the sake of the teacher who may be confronted
with a child that stutters, definite directions are given
regarding specific subjects,—so definite that if carried
out, the child will be materially aided and in
most cases cured.</p>

<p class='c007'>The teacher must have the very best methods at
hand and understand their application in order to
help a child that stutters. She must remember that
every method she uses will be of no avail if the child
knows that she is “using a method.” Therefore, in
whatever she does there should be no ostentation.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the first grade there is little work that requires
oral recitations other than the first crude attempts
at reading, numbers and language. In busy work,
drawing and writing, the child need say nothing.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Learning to Read</div>

<p class='c007'>In the reading, the teacher must be careful not to
have the child read too long sentences by himself.
The teacher should read with him; by so doing she
helps him along without the irritation of stuttering.
She must read in a firm, even tone of voice. A teacher
who has a harsh voice will often do more harm than
good, if she doesn’t control her voice. One of the
very best things to do, during the first week of school,
is to have all the pupils memorize several easy songs
and poems. When the teacher first calls up the class,
she may say, “Now, children, we will all say our
poem together.” The teacher must speak it with the
pupils for the first week or two. The stuttering child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_655'>655</span>must be watched to be sure that he repeats the poem
with the others. Speaking it with the others carries
the child along and he can say in concert what he
could not utter alone without stuttering. Then the
teacher may say to some other pupils, “Mary you and
I will speak the poem together.” The teacher should
choose the pupil who has memorized the poem best
and who has a good voice. Next she may repeat it
with Mary and the stuttering child and finally alone
with the stuttering child. By this plan the afflicted
child will not once suspect that an effort is being
made to help him personally. Such a drill can
be given at the beginning of every lesson and will
materially help the stutterer. The lesson following
the drill should always be simple. Care should
be taken that any sentence he is asked to read or
repeat is not too long and that it is clearly understood.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing is better for speech drill than number
work. In counting, have the child count slowly and
plainly. Never require him to count farther than he
knows. If he can count to ten, have him count to
ten, then say, “Now, you and I will count together to
twelve.” Then count with him to and including
twelve. Repeat the counting; then say to the child,
“Now you count to twelve by yourself.” As soon as
he shows the least tendency to stutter, count with
him. The counting can be prolonged little by little.
Counting in concert will also be helpful.</p>

<p class='c007'>In language work the greatest care must be exercised.
It is difficult for the best of pupils in the first
grade to tell a story, much more so for the stuttering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_656'>656</span>child. Even though he may know the story, it would
not be helping him to have him tell it, for just as
soon as he becomes confused in thought, he will begin
to stutter, and since the teacher does not know just
what the child wishes to say next, she can not help
him. The situation differs in this case from that of
number work and reading; for the teacher can repeat
what the child wants to say in those subjects knowing
what comes next. However, the child must be taught
something in language; he dare not be neglected. He
is too young to write the story; hence it is necessary
to give him special work. Special work has its drawback
because the child notices that he does not do
what the other children are doing and begins to feel
that he is being singled out for particular work, and
that is especially to be avoided; hence the teacher
must use such work as can be employed for the other
pupils.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following plan has been used in the very best
of primary schools, and is, perhaps, one of the most
effective methods for first grade language work: a
method that will secure correct and exact expression,
just the thing that should be emphasized in oral
English.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Pictures</div>

<p class='c007'>The teacher selects story pictures; not gaudy or
highly colored ones, but such as are simple and full
of real life—“Can’t You Talk?” “Kiss Me,” “Village
Blacksmith,” “Feeding the Hens,” “Friends or
Foes,” “Lessons in Boat Building,” “Oversleeping,”
“No Thoroughfare,” “Which Do You Like,” “Family
Cares,” “Saved,” and a well chosen Madonna or
two. These pictures can be obtained from the Perry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_657'>657</span>Pictures Collection at one cent each; they come in
soft grays and browns. The teacher can ask, “What
do you see?” Have each child hold up his hand
when he sees something. Instruct the children to
begin their statements with “I see, etc.” Call first
upon one of the best pupils. He will no doubt say, “I
see a little girl.” Then if the stuttering child has
his hand up, call upon him. He will say, “I see a
dog.” He will utter this easily because he has had
time to think what he wishes to say. Then the teacher
may ask what the pupils think the little girl is saying.
Give each pupil plenty of time to think. As
the hands go up, call upon the best pupil first. Have
the child begin the statement, “I think the little girl
is saying....” Allow each child to express himself,
including the child that stutters. Never call upon
the stuttering child first. At this point the teacher
may tell the class to be seated while she relates the
story of the picture.</p>

<p class='c007'>The teacher should avoid such pictures as “Washington
Crossing the Delaware,” “The Landing of the
Pilgrims,” “The Signing of the Declaration of Independence,”
etc. They are full of action, to be sure,
but too difficult for the children to understand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whatever the subject taught, the general rule is
this: When calling on the child who stutters, let the
teacher ask some question which can be easily and
quickly answered. As for instance in a geography
lesson: “Does Ohio lie east or west of Virginia?”
Upon receiving the answer let her approve if the
right answer is given, and in either case, immediately
center attention upon some other pupil. You will find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_658'>658</span>that elation over your approval will help the stutterer
to get into the habit of reciting when you call
upon him, especially if attention is immediately centered
upon some other pupil, so that he may lose
self-consciousness over his speech defect in reciting
before the class.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is asking much from a teacher to work so patiently
each day of a school year to cure a stuttering
child. It is infringing upon the other pupils’
time; but teacher and pupils should all be glad to
sacrifice enough to help one child for life over a defect
that will make or mar his success and happiness.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few general rules must be remembered by
the teacher who attempts to remedy the defect of
stuttering.</p>

<p class='c007'>First, never call upon the child to recite suddenly.
That tends to excite him and will cause him to stutter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Secondly, a pupil can not express what he does not
fully have in mind. Another child may be able to
think while speaking, but the stutterer can not. To
try to think while he speaks will make him stutter.
Always give plenty of time to get into mind what
is to be said, and then call upon him to say it. The
chances are that he will express himself without
stuttering. Even when the child holds up his hand,
wait a few seconds so he will be sure to know what
he wants to say.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thirdly, the stuttering child will learn slowly.
He should not be hurried. What he learns should all
be so learned that he will have no indefinite ideas.
He can not express what he does not fully understand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lastly, a teacher must not lose patience with a child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_659'>659</span>that stutters. If he does not know the lesson, have
him reproduce something from a past lesson, something
he knows well. Approve his effort and say
nothing about the lesson he did not know.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be added also that there is no better school
exercise for a stuttering child than singing. He can
sing without stuttering what he cannot express otherwise.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Written Expression</p>

<div class='sidenote'>First Grade</div>

<p class='c007'>(1) <i>Scribbling and drawing on books, sidewalks,
etc.</i> As soon as children can write so as to express the
simplest ideas in writing, and drawing, they begin
to write and draw promiscuously in their books, on
their desks, on the pavement, on fences, on buildings
and anywhere they discover a surface upon which
they can write. They frequently steal crayon in order
to satisfy their desire to write and draw. Their
names appear at odd places; in fact they have a mania
for writing their names upon all their school property.
The tendency is not bad in itself, but it often leads to
bad results. Every pupil should know that his name is
his own appellation and he should regard it as sacred.
It is brazen and disrespectful to have one’s name
promiscuously scattered about in writing. But there
are worse phases of this habit of writing and drawing
on anything within reach. A teacher may have been
embarrassed to pass over the pavement, along a building
or by the fence and to see her name in connection
with that of some man whom the pupils believe to be
her sweetheart; she may even find the same in the
pupils’ books. Still another type and the worst one,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_660'>660</span>is the writing of immoral phrases and the drawing of
obscene pictures. Often little children do not know
the full import of what they are doing.</p>

<p class='c007'>It cannot be unpedagogical or a violation of any
principle to teach pupils not to write their names
about carelessly, not to write others’ names and bad
phrases or silly statements in their books, not to draw
any kind of picture in improper places, and not to
deface their desks. It has been stated so many times
that direct teaching of good habits can and must be
done in all sincerity on the teacher’s part. There
need not be one harsh or unkind word said. The talk
to pupils on these matters must be given in a friendly
and helpful spirit.</p>

<p class='c007'>All parents desire that their children take good
care of their school books and accessories. Still many
first grade pupils fall into the habit of taking the
poorest care of school property. Should there be
pupils who show a tendency to misuse their books
by writing in them, the teacher may tell the pupils
that she is going to put the names of every pupil on
the board and then for each week that a pupil takes
good care of his books, she will put a star after that
child’s name. When he gets a certain number of
stars, perhaps four, she may allow some special privilege
or it may not be amiss to give a pencil or a picture
as a reward. Little folk will exert great effort
to secure a small favor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Examples of the abuse of written expression have
been used so copiously in the elaboration of other
cases that the subject is treated very meagerly here.
The following is, however, a typical case.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_661'>661</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>CASE 123 (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>
</div>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Marking Books</div>

<p class='c007'>Something was wrong in the McLain High School;
even Orpha Barbour, one of the most decorous girls
in school, was ineffectually trying to keep from giggling.
Mr. Coleman endeavored to locate the cause
of the disturbance and saw that a book was being surreptitiously
passed about and that whoever received
it was vastly amused.</p>

<p class='c007'>He demanded that the book be given to him. On
the fly leaf he saw what was named “Our museum.”
Under this title were caricatures of some of the students
as follows: under the drawing of tall, slender
Clayton Lynd was written “Spider—C. L.” Heavy-jawed
Barney McCormack was designated “Bulldog—B.
McC.” Then followed the monkey; the crawfish,
a girl who was always ready to recant; the queen
bee, the leader among the girls; the mule, a stubborn
fellow; and the grasshopper, Mr. Coleman, who had
made a great leap to reach an unruly boy a day or
two before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who did this drawing?” asked Mr. Coleman,
flushed with anger.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nobody seemed to know.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Coleman turned to the front of the book—an
algebra—and found it belonged to Victor Tucker.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Victor Tucker, did you draw these disgraceful
pictures?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you know who did it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d rather not answer,” said Victor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are suspended, sir, until you do answer,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_662'>662</span>said Mr. Coleman. Then turning to address all of
the students, he said, “I shall keep a close watch for
marked-up books hereafter, and shall punish every
pupil who puts extraneous markings of any kind in
any of his textbooks.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Coleman should have laughed at the caricatures
and said, “These are well done—now let us take up
something else.” Do not lay down a law or make a
rule covering “all future cases.” He should utilize
these artistic gifts in the school routine and so make
them educative instead of obstructive to good school
order.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Rules are often a dare to pupils. The bold ones
take pleasure in seeing if they cannot break the rules
without being caught, or sometimes even openly disobey
to see if the prescribed penalty will be administered.
Approval of good conduct is more efficacious
than condemnation of bad behavior.</p>

<p class='c007'>An up-to-date teacher quickly discovers all of his
pupils who have an aptitude for drawing, whether it
be crude or well trained. In every subject in school
there is not only opportunity but also urgent need for
the use of diagrams, sketches and detailed drawings
to make clear many obscure points in these subjects.
If the teacher will direct into approved channels these
tendencies to decorate books and public places, great
relief will be gained and immense profit will accrue
to the pupils.</p>

  <h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>
</div>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Approve the Clean Book</div>

<p class='c007'>Prof. Pierce of Lakeville High School has the habit
of picking up books from pupils’ desks and glancing
through them occasionally while recitations are going
on. When he finds an exceptionally clean, well kept
book he says, “I like to see a neat book like this. It is
a good index to the kind of boy that owns it.” He
has no trouble regarding marked up textbooks.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Lower Grade</div>

<p class='c007'>(2) <i>Learning to write neatly.</i> It is not an easy
task to take the early steps in writing which are so
highly interesting for the first grade child. Still less
easy is the training in carefulness, neatness and accuracy.
Much of the difficulty is due, however, to the
fact that the teacher attempts too much at one time,
is not sufficiently explicit in giving directions, forgets
that little children learn quickest through imitation,
and lastly that they constantly need the stimulus of
approval for effort, and coöperation in the mastery of
new and difficult tasks.</p>

<p class='c007'>As an initial step toward overcoming any neglect
in these directions we would suggest that whenever
any task is assigned, you first tell the child very definitely
how you want the work done. Assume that the
child does not know as well as you just what you mean
by the word “careful.” Show concretely just what
you do mean. Take a blank piece of paper and write
before him on his desk. Assign some simple, concrete
thing for him to write and say, “Now, this is the way
to do it.” Or, “Here is something I want you to write
for me. Now I have found that a good way to do it is
like this:” (then show the child your plan on paper).</p>

<p class='c007'>Take time enough at the child’s desk to say, “Do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_664'>664</span>you see what I mean?” “Do you understand how
I want it done?” No matter what the child says,
repeat your plan briefly, so that he will be sure to
remember. Leave his desk smiling and say, “I’ll come
back to your desk after you have finished and see how
well you did it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Do not give the pupil a hard task. In fact, make
it very easy and simple. Then go back to the pupil’s
desk in ten or fifteen minutes, and make up your mind
before you go back that you will not say anything at
all to the pupil except to approve those parts of his
work that are at all good. For example, say, “There’s
a very good letter ‘O’; I am not sure that I could
beat that myself, and there’s another good letter—and
there’s another. Well, I should say! That’s all
right. I am going to give you some more work like
that tomorrow. I did not know you could do so good
work.” Leave the desk while the child is feeling
elated over what you have said.</p>

<p class='c007'>Repeat the same procedure the next day. Vary
the introduction somewhat, like this: “I want you to
do this just as you did yesterday, except that I want
this margin over here on the right side to be on a
straight line. Wait till I take this ruler and show
you.” Lay the ruler lengthwise of the sheet you want
the pupil to write on, so that you can take your lead
pencil and make a line about an inch from the right
side of the page. “Now, when you have written out
to this line here, then stop and begin on the next line
like this:” (show the child how you write a sentence
and begin on the next line). It would be well if the
sentence which you use as an example were to be one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_665'>665</span>that would express some familiar thought about the
child’s immediate interests, such as his favorite sport.
Leave the child’s desk as you were advised to leave it
the day before and also return as before and approve
that which the pupil does well, either saying absolutely
nothing about the careless parts or suggest incidently
that the pupil could help such and such a
part by doing this or that thing to it. Be sure to end
your remarks by some such expression as, “That’s
good,” or “That’s fine.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Lower Grades</div>

<p class='c007'>(3) <i>Learning to Draw.</i> Not infrequently it happens
that a pupil comes into school who has never
learned to draw and who, feeling his inability to accomplish
the task set for him in the drawing lesson,
refuses to make any attempt to do so. Especially is
this true if the picture is to be drawn from imagination.
In such a case it is best to begin with copying.
When this art is learned, drawing from imagination
will be a comparatively easy step.</p>

<p class='c007'>For example, choose a very simple picture for the
child to reproduce on another piece of paper. It is a
good plan for a teacher to have at least a dozen or more
pictures in one drawer of his desk all the time, because
many pupils like to draw and copy pictures and it is
an excellent way to get them interested in other work.
Present the picture of some ordinary scene. Tell the
pupil before he begins that you are going to make a
collection of pictures which your pupils draw. The
picture need not have much life in it to start with, but
right here we make use of the child’s imagination to
wonderful advantage. Suppose the picture, which
you have in hand, shows a tree or two, a house, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_666'>666</span>couple of bushes or any kind of natural objects whatsoever.
Talk to the pupil in this fashion, pointing to
different parts of the picture with your pencil and
have your face near the picture, indicating interest
and enthusiasm as you talk: “Now, right behind this
tree here, I want you to draw a boy, sticking his head
out from behind the tree. And right over here, where
I make this little cross mark, I want you to draw a
little girl hiding behind this bush. We will suppose
they are playing ‘Hide and Seek.’ Right over here,
between this tree and the house, draw a boy’s hat.
Maybe he has lost it while he was running to hide.
You know how to make a hat. Just like this:” (draw
a very simple hat, merely making a straight line and
a semi-circle connecting two points in it.) “Maybe
you can draw a better one than that. I’ll come back
to your desk pretty soon and see what kind of a hat
you drew and also that little boy sticking his head out
from behind the tree. Is your pencil sharp enough?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The child will say that his pencil is all right. Then
leave him at once and in ten or fifteen minutes return.
Go back with this one thought in mind, that
you will say nothing at all except that which is complimentary.
For example, say, “Well, I should say
you <i>can</i> draw. I believe you made a better hat than
I did. Now this afternoon, I am going to give you
something else to draw. Maybe a pony with a boy on
his back and a girl riding in the pony cart. You are
going to be good at drawing things for me, I know.
I want to keep all of your drawings after you have
finished them for me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In case the child should interrupt and ask to draw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_667'>667</span>the pony right away instead of waiting until afternoon,
answer by saying, “I will have the picture ready
for you after dinner and then I will bring it to you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course, it is not necessary to use the exact words
we have suggested, or to use the same pictures or
even to use pictures at all. The important point is to
offer something that is at once interesting in order
to get the pupil started in drawing. Do not insist
much upon regular lessons during the first day or
two in which your chief problem is to get the pupil’s
confidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the child has learned to like to do the things
which you suggest present more difficult, or even
purely imaginative, subjects for drawing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Use the same method in getting the child to take
an interest in other subjects than drawing—that is,
give him very small tasks, then approve and compliment
him on his ability. This will bring good results
with any pupil who is normal.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a transition step between mere copying and drawing
wholly from the imagination, and also to give the
timid child confidence enough to come to the blackboard
to draw in the presence of other children, the
following might be tried.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having the confidence of the little pupil, go to his
desk just before school closes in the evening and say,
“I would like for you to stay just a moment after
school. I want to tell you something.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After most of the pupils have marched out, return
to his desk, begin to talk enthusiastically about a picture
which you have. Tell him to follow you and you
will try to draw it. Then after reaching the blackboard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_668'>668</span>and picking up a piece of crayon, say, “Now,
I am going to draw this man’s face and I want you to
draw his eyes.” Let it take you about a minute to
draw the outline of the man’s face, talking all the
time about how well you like to draw pictures, then
say, “Now let’s see if you can draw his eyes. Make a
mark right there” (point to a spot). “Good! Now
draw his other eye. Good! Now his ear. Make a
mark right here” (point to a spot). “My, that’s fine.
See, what a fine man you drew.” Start to leave the
blackboard and say, “I’m going to have you draw for
me again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Repeat this process every day until you feel sure
that the child will go to the blackboard and work in
the presence of yourself and the class.</p>

<p class='c011'>Only through the gateway of personal experience does the

achievement of humanity.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CASES ARISING OUT OF THE SOCIAL INSTINCTS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>1. The Unsocial Child</p>

<p class='c007'>Every teacher knows of a first grade child that came
moping when all the other pupils were in high glee,
that stood by himself when others were enjoying a
game, that preferred to come to school alone and to
saunter home alone, that took no part in any of the
activities that always interest other youngsters, that
even seemed indifferent to the friendly approaches of
playmates and teacher. There may be no particular
harm in having such a child in school, but should he
carry such traits into adult life, they would prove a
serious handicap; so it is important that the teacher
should attempt to help him to throw off his peculiarities.
This can be accomplished very easily. In attempting
a cure she should not make the child feel
that she thinks him different from other pupils.</p>

<p class='c007'>The best place to begin helping the child is on the
playground. Talk to him about the interesting features
of the games. Though he may not at first show
interest, the teacher should keep this up for several
days, until he has learned to know the teacher as a
friend. Then she can invite him to join in the games.
It is only an abnormal child that will not enter into
the sport after repeated invitations.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the child has taken an active part in the games,
the teacher may begin to pay special attention to him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_672'>672</span>in the school-room. To cause the child to eliminate
his peculiarities is entirely a matter of arousing his
devotion to those things which interest other children.
The teacher should appeal to his interests until she
has won his complete confidence. Then she should
introduce him to a new activity. Little by little she will
displace the child’s peculiarities with abiding concern
in all those things that interest the other children.</p>

<p class='c007'>The individual who reaches mature life still possessed
of characteristics that make him an exceptional
person is likely to lead a more or less isolated life
unless his peculiarities are such as to make him acceptable
as a leader. Under ordinary conditions, “society
tends to penalize those who do not conform to
its customs, its standards, its attitudes.” This is true
even of the unsocial, or non-social individual; still
more does it hold in respect to the anti-social member
of the group.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Anti-Social Tendencies—Selfishness,
Jealousy, Cliques and Snobbishness</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) <i>Selfishness.</i> Selfishness is a trait of character
that has always elicited severe criticism from society.
Its manifestations are so conspicuous that they provoke
men to despise and avoid the confirmed egoist.
It is an anti-social trait, hence deserving of the opprobrium
placed upon it, yet it is the basis of all the social
virtues, hence the place which is here given to it in
the division on “Social Instincts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We may well believe that selfishness was a universal
trait of the race in its infancy. By this is meant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_673'>673</span>that every individual instinctively seeks to care for his
own interests above those of anyone else. All during
the earlier months, and perhaps years, of one’s childhood,
he measures the world in terms of its service to
his own comfort and pleasure. As one who merges
into later childhood and into adult life, he normally
narrows the play of this trait of character, and inhibits
those impulses which, if followed out, would
make him a selfish person. Adults who are justly accused
of being selfish are persons who have never
fully profited from their contact with their fellows,
nor have they learned how to suppress adequately
their own personal desires and demands.</p>

<p class='c007'>Selfishness is a relative term. This is due to the
fact that individuals differ from each other widely in
the matter of natural endowments. The standard of
measure used in judging selfishness in people is both
individual and social. Most frequently the charge of
selfishness is lodged because an individual is not as
unselfish as the group in which he most often appears,
but in fairness he must also be judged with an eye to
the intensity of his native egoistic impulses. From
this point of view, what may be selfish in one person is
not selfish in another.</p>

<p class='c007'>The misunderstanding of children in interpreting
their apparent selfishness is very easy. The traditions
of the home may have accentuated the natural
propensity to care for their own interests beyond that
which would have been the case had they had other
surroundings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Furthermore, the known variation in natural endowments,
and in the responses to social influences, require
<span class='pageno' id='Page_674'>674</span>one to be lenient in passing judgment upon selfish
people.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Its Nature</div>

<p class='c007'>As commonly understood, the selfish individual is
one who exhibits an excessive concern for his own
welfare, who tends to regard himself as a little god,
watching every opportunity to satisfy his desires,
tastes, impulses and pleasures. He measures every
passing circumstance in terms of its value to him.
Even the occasional acts of kindness which he renders
to another are planned so as to bring him the largest
returns financially or socially.</p>

<p class='c007'>We must not forget that selfishness is an indestructible
instinct of human nature. On this instinct is
deeply engraved the law of self-preservation. Experience
in associating with ones’ fellows shows to an
ordinary person how far he must take precautions in
order to maintain his own welfare, but in the case of
a few, as we believe, results of experience have not
given the wisdom which renders them unselfish.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are never to forget that the will to live underlies
and overtops all other interests and desires in the
life of the individual. No sane method will attempt
to suppress this impulse, for out of it spring all the
impulses that induce the individual to seek his fortune
and win success in life.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Causes</div>

<p class='c007'>For the better understanding of selfishness in children,
it is well to survey some of the general causes
that operate in prolonging selfishness into later childhood
and adult life.</p>

<p class='c007'>First of all, we mention misconception of one’s
actual need. By this we mean that a child overestimates
his need for some object that interests him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_675'>675</span>He “wants” it very much, as we say. He is unable,
by reason of his immaturity, to estimate accurately
his own necessities in the case. Another specific cause
of selfishness is a wrong estimate of the value which
belongs to the object of his eager desire. For these
reasons he is willing to pay too high a price to satisfy
himself with that which, if he were better informed,
he could forego with little discomfort.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, the attainment of success after long and
victorious effort may beget in one a spirit of selfishness.
Not infrequently a student who has solved a difficult
problem after painstaking toil, hesitates to pass
on the fruits of his labor to a classmate. He reasons
that the expenditure of energy which he has suffered
is worth too much to be lightly transferred to another
person. Particularly will this be the case if the
sharing of his gain will reduce the lustre of his own
glory.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another particular cause of selfishness, both in
adults and in children, is the transition from poverty
to plenty, from obscurity to prominence, from disesteem
to fame. If the father or mother has recently
emerged from some retired station in life, the contrast
in the situation is very sure to be reflected in the life
of the younger members of the family. If the change
is from poverty to wealth, the parents are disposed to
be miserly in the expenditure of their money. This
attitude of mind reappears in the child in a refusal to
share his pleasures and privileges with his schoolmates.
He carries with him a caution to see that no
one trespasses upon his newly achieved rights. In our
western civilization such extreme transitions are not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_676'>676</span>infrequent, owing to the freedom of opportunity
for all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many times people who are not widely acquainted
with the world are selfish because they do not believe
in the good will of others. This state of mind is
very often found in young children who have not yet
advanced beyond a sort of savagery in which they
regard every man as a possible enemy. They refuse
to give up to their associates because they do not believe
any return will come to them. They fear that
all of their possessions will be ravaged and appropriated,
and so exercise excessive caution in lending them
or in making presents to their friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not unusual that certain interests of some society,
class, or club, are so vividly conceived as to modify
the attitude of the entire group.</p>

<p class='c007'>A fraternity or literary society or a senior class
in a high school may hold inflated ideas of their importance,
and think necessarily that school interests
should rotate around their welfare. Individuals who
belong to the club or society become intoxicated with
this notion, and exhibit an almost barbaric class-selfishness.</p>

<p class='c007'>With these and other incentives to selfishness, the
situation facing a conscientious teacher is by no means
simple. Since selfishness is a very intimate trait of
character, the question might be raised why a teacher
could take interest in curing children of selfishness.
The fault has been generated very largely in the home,
and the cure should, naturally, be largely a matter of
home concern.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cure</div>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless the public school teacher has a large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_677'>677</span>responsibility. He must attempt to improve the character
of the child in every way possible. Obviously,
the cure of selfishness can be had only by associating
with other people. It depends upon the teacher to
manipulate these associations in school so as to aid in
reforming character at this point.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just as clearly, the more startling instances of selfishness
necessitate care that the rights of other pupils
be preserved. This happens so frequently as to demand
no elaborate argument.</p>

<p class='c007'>The teacher’s concern for the general improvement
of the moral life of the school requires that striking
instances of selfishness should be adequately dealt
with.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lastly, selfishness is a prolific source of other wrongs.
If an administrator can cure a selfish child, he has
nipped in the bud a whole harvest of undesirable
actions and immoral deeds.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>First Grade</div>

<p class='c007'>No teacher would ever think of punishing a first
grade child in any way whatever for being selfish.
The selfish child is usually an only child or has been
made selfish in his desires, by home training. The
teacher can do much to overcome selfishness. When a
pupil enters the first grade, for the first time, he comes
in contact with other children and into surroundings
that are new. This is the teacher’s opportunity. The
chances are that the child will often display selfish
tendencies. It is necessary that the teacher have the
child’s confidence, but by this time it is assumed that
the teacher has many avenues already mapped out by
which to get this needed confidence. Then the thing
to do is to teach the child unselfishness each time he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_678'>678</span>displays selfish tendencies. It will take but a few
weeks to effect some change in the selfish child.</p>

<p class='c007'>In extreme cases it may be well for the teacher to
give the child something for the express purpose of
asking him to share it with his playmates—candy,
pictures or any little, inexpensive article that a child
enjoys.</p>

<p class='c007'>For example, if the teacher has given candy, she
may say, “Now, break it in two pieces and give one
piece to Mary.” When the child has done so the
teacher should approve the act. It will incline the
child away from selfishness for the teacher to say,
“You are kind to give Mary some of your candy.”
“I like the way you divide with others,” or, “You
like to give things to others, don’t you?” This last
statement of approval will require the child to reply,
“Yes.” This is a necessary positive reaction of the
child and a few trials like this may overcome his
selfishness.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trait of selfishness, while not very annoying in
the first grade, must be suppressed, for if left to develop,
it becomes very annoying in the upper grades.
Nothing seems worse than a selfish pupil in the grammar
or high school. And no one needs an introduction
to the avaricious man of the world who got his
first lessons in greed through selfishness in childhood.
For the sake of emphasis, then, may it be said again
that there is no more opportune time to overcome
these undesirable traits in a child, than when he first
enters a new world of acquaintances and experiences
in the first school year.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_679'>679</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>CASE 124 (FIRST GRADE)</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The spoiled child has two dominating characteristics—an
intense selfishness and an insatiable appetite for
attention. The teacher’s problem is therefore two-fold,
first, to reduce his self-consciousness by increasing
his interest in the world about him, and, secondly,
to enlist his sympathies for others so as to increase his
altruism and supplant his selfishness with a wholesome
socialization.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Spoiled Child</div>

<p class='c007'>Karen Gompers was a very bright little girl whom
adoring parents, aunts, grandparents and enlisted
friends had quite spoiled. She expected her teacher to
give her the constant attention she enjoyed at home,
and resented the fact that Miss Nelson seemed to think
each of forty other children as important as she was.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I want to sit by you,” she announced as her class
seated itself in the circle of little chairs. “I like to
be here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can’t sit by me today, Karen. It is Wilson’s
and Eunice’s turn. You may sit in that empty chair
over there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I don’t want to! I want to sit here!” and
she stood stoutly by the coveted chair. All the other
children were watching her, and she was enjoying her
prominence in the scene she was creating. Miss Nelson
hated a scene above all things, and prided herself on
the perfect mechanics of her teaching.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Wilson, suppose you let Karen sit here
today—that’s a good boy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you promised me I could!” There were sudden
tears in Wilson’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll let you sit here another day, Wilson. Be a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_680'>680</span>little gentleman, and remember that gentlemen give
up their chairs to girls.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So Karen had her way because she had learned the
despotism of the selfish, who secure their ends by sheer
insistence. Wilson lost his faith in his teacher’s word,
which did not tend to make him a gentleman, and Miss
Nelson proved herself a coward in consenting to sacrifice
Karen’s good to her own dislike of a conflict.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>There are occasions when a definite issue for the
mastery occurs in the school-room, and this was one of
them. Miss Nelson had no right to break her promise
to a docile and obedient child, and reinforce the habitual
selfishness of a spoiled one. She should have insisted
that Karen take her turn with the rest, and if
Karen had stormed it would have given her a good
opportunity to show her that her usual methods would
not work in school. The angry storming of a spoiled
child is usually done with an alert eye to the effect
produced on the audience; therefore, if Karen had
wept and wailed, she should have been carried out into
the hall, where she might have been left in lonely state
to recover her good temper. Usually one or two such
trials convince a spoiled child that he has met his
match, and if such children are followed by tactful
guidance, and especially if attention can be diverted
away from themselves, the worst-spoiled children can
in time be thoroughly socialized.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>In every case, the object of the teacher’s treatment
is to show the child that he must conform to the conditions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_681'>681</span>of the social group he belongs to, instead of
fixing conditions to suit himself. She should remember,
however, that <i>real</i> unselfishness has not been attained
until the child voluntarily surrenders some fancied
good. Coercion may sometimes be a stepping
stone in leading a child toward the goal, but it is only
a stepping stone. True unselfishness requires that
the child himself deliberately make the choice that
crowns another with the happiness that he desired for
himself.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (KINDERGARTEN)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Substitute Altruistic Ideal</div>

<p class='c007'>Elmer Bronson, an only child, had a difficult task
in adjusting himself to his social environment when,
at the age of four, he entered the public school kindergarten
in Grand Rapids, Michigan. At home all playthings
had been his, with none to molest or take away.
Moreover, as the grown-ups in his home were very
indulgent, practically all objects that he desired to
have were placed at his disposal.</p>

<p class='c007'>But at school a new order seemed to prevail. Elmer
not only was not allowed to appropriate many interesting
looking objects that lay about on desks and
tables, but at times he was not even permitted unrestricted
handling of his own things. The situation
was perplexing. He couldn’t make it out.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Melbourne, Elmer’s teacher, comprehended the
conditions of the problem better than he did. She
perceived that Elmer, as yet, had no understanding of
the meaning of ownership, nor had he received any
training whatever in the recognition of the rights of
others. She must begin at the foundation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_682'>682</span>To that end she utilized all sorts of games, stories
and dramatic plays as a means for teaching these two
lessons, but that part of the program which seemed
to captivate Elmer more than any other was the singing
of “The Soldier Boy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The delightful part of it was that as the song was
sung the children marched about the room wearing
paper caps of red, white and blue, and each, as he
marched, was presented by his teacher with a flag to
be proudly borne over the right shoulder. Who could
fail to be patriotic and generous under such stimulating
conditions!</p>

<p class='c007'>One day Elmer spied a toy boat on the desk of one
of his classmates, Freddie Buzzell. Elmer immediately
appropriated it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t take my boat,” said Freddie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“’Tain’t yours. It’s mine,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>Naturally, Freddie sprang to the defense of his
property rights. Elmer insisted upon the principle
of possession as proof of ownership. Thus the battle
was raging when Miss Melborne entered the room.
Knowing Elmer’s individualistic tendencies, she was
not long in getting at the cause of the quarrel.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come here, Elmer,” she called from the desk.
Elmer came reluctantly, still holding the toy boat.
Miss Melborne picked up one of the red, white, and
blue caps on the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who are the boys these caps were made for,
Elmer?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sojer boys.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what sort of boys are they?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Those ‘whose hearts are brave and twue.’”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_683'>683</span>“Now, Elmer, soldiers who are ‘brave and true’
have to fight sometimes but do they fight in order
to get something they want themselves, or do they
fight to take care of other people?” This was a pretty
hard question for Elmer to think out fully. He looked
thoughtful but did not answer. Miss Melborne tried
a more concrete form of question.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We would not like to have any one march with
the ‘soldier boys’ this afternoon who takes things
away from other children, <i>would</i> we?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Elmer looked very sober, but he shook his head.
Miss Melborne followed up the advantage she had
gained by adding, “What would a soldier boy ‘whose
heart is brave and true’ do, if he had in his hands
something that belonged to another boy?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Elmer looked hard at the toy boat for a full minute,
then slowly walked over to Freddie’s desk and carefully
placed the boat on it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s my brave soldier boy!” said Miss Melborne,
enthusiastically. “That’s the kind of boy to
wear the soldier cap!” and she placed it on his head,
adding, as she did so, “You may wear it, dear, till the
school bell rings.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The idea of protection of the rights of others had
been substituted for that of selfish possession. Approval
had crystallized the experience into an attitude
of mind. Many reminders of the soldier boy, “whose
heart was brave and true” and who lived for others
instead of self, were necessary before the most selfish
child in the class became one of the most unselfish, but
each application on the teacher’s part of the principles
of substitution and approval made the meaning of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_684'>684</span>words more explicit to Elmer and the habit of self-sacrifice
more firmly fixed.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 125 (RURAL SCHOOL)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Not infrequently it happens that the selfish child
has a continual example of selfishness before him in
his own parents.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Parental Example</div>

<p class='c007'>Not far from the rural school house in District
Number 10 was the fine residence of Mr. Allen, one
of the directors of the school. His rearing of thoroughbred
stock had made his name known throughout
the state and had added thousands to his bank account.
When his little son, Homer, started to school for the
first time, he was oversupplied with pencils, erasers,
tablets of all varieties, penholders, stencils, paints,
colored crayons and every known aid to first grade
work.</p>

<p class='c007'>Attending the same school was a large family of very
poor children named Perkins. The Perkins’ children
were poorly, but cleanly, clad in the cheapest of clothing.
They had only a few of the necessary textbooks
and half of a lead pencil was made to serve two of the
family, the parents reasoning that two of them
wouldn’t surely need lead pencils at the same time.
Joseph and Clarence Perkins were in the first and second
grades, respectively. They had the third of a lead
pencil to be used in common and a piece of a broken
slate (with a two-inch pencil) to be used instead of a
tablet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Shuttlesworth, a young teacher, felt truly
sorry for these two bright, little boys because they
were thus handicapped in their work, and she allowed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_685'>685</span>them to borrow from other children during
periods when both should be writing at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>She even fell into the habit of saying, “Joseph,
borrow a pencil from Homer and put your problems
on this piece of paper.” Generous and kindly herself
it did not occur to her that Homer was reluctant to
loan one of his many pencils.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day Laura Manning, a sixteen-year-old pupil
who came past the Allen farm on her way to school,
said to Miss Shuttlesworth, “Mrs. Allen said to tell
you she would like to have you come and see her soon.”
Miss Shuttlesworth foresaw from Laura’s manner of
delivering the message that the errand would not be
a pleasant one. She had evidently offended Mrs. Allen
in some way, but how she could not conceive. She had
never been in the Allen home nor had she ever seen
Mrs. Allen.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as school closed she made her way to the
Allen residence and was not surprised to have Mrs.
Allen greet her coldly and haughtily, boldly glaring
at her and beginning a speech something like this: “I
want you to understand that Homer is not to lend
anything of his to the Perkins’ children. We are able
to buy anything he needs but we don’t intend to buy
for the whole school.” Having more than exhausted
this subject Mrs. Allen went on to state that Homer’s
seat must be changed because his desk was defective
in some way. Miss Shuttlesworth had not noticed that
Homer’s desk was different from the others.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was a young teacher and so was quite overawed
by Mrs. Allen’s angry, commanding tones. She
changed Homer’s seat and supplied the Perkins’ boys
<span class='pageno' id='Page_686'>686</span>with working material herself. She made no effort
to change Homer’s attitude of superiority toward the

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>When children are not supplied with the necessary
equipment for their work and are too poor to buy for
themselves make an appeal to the board of education
asking them to purchase the material needed, which
material should be considered the property of the
school and left there from year to year. Most states
require that the school furnish books and equipment
for all who are unable to buy them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Show by your own example that poor people are
just as desirable for companions as rich ones, other
things being equal. See to it that the children of poor
parents be made to forget, while at school, that they
are different from others. See to it that democracy
reigns on the playground.</p>

<p class='c007'>Supervise all play.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do not foster the borrowing habit.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>If children are unable to buy books, allowing them to
borrow daily is a source of annoyance to both borrower
and lender. Besides it daily emphasizes the contrast
in the financial condition between the richer and the
poorer. This is wrong. It fosters haughtiness in the
one and undue humiliation in the other. While you
are supervising play you can easily manage to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_687'>687</span>the neglected children drawn into play and even chosen
for the enviable parts in the games. It largely depends
upon the teacher’s influence whether the public school
is a leveler of false barriers or a hotbed where selfishness
is cultivated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The borrowing habit, if fostered even among children
of equal rank, teaches a disregard for the property
rights of others. Americans are especially lax in their
thought and behavior relative to property rights, and
the public schools can do the nation a great service by
giving its children correct notions concerning appropriation
without ownership, and in selfishness as contrasted
with altruism, in both rich and poor. The rich
often enjoy display and the poor retaliate by vandalism.
Both wrongs are the outgrowth of selfishness.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Invoking Fairies</div>

<p class='c007'>Margaret Blake lived not far from the Lone Star
rural school. Her father had bought much land years
before which had so increased in value that he was very
rich. Many people in the Lone Star district were tenants
on his farms. Margaret’s mother taught her that
she was better than other children and must not “mix”
with them more than absolutely necessary. As soon
as she was old enough she was to go to a “select”
school of her own “class” of people.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Coleman saw the situation the first day of
school. Margaret’s selfishness was manifested by her
selection of the best seat, the display on her desk of
numerous and costly aids for her work, her haughty
demeanor and her frequent references to what her
mother said she need not do. Whenever she spoke of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_688'>688</span>her mother’s wishes she emphasized the “I” in a way
to show her difference from others.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Coleman knew that the happiness of Margaret
as well as of her other pupils depended upon eradication
of the rich child’s selfishness. She made a special
study of the effect of various attempts to accomplish
this end. She told a story of an unselfish child. This
did not seem to appeal to Margaret. She tried another
story on the advantages of wealth in terms of ability to
serve others. This was nearer the mark. After thus
finding the correct avenue of approach Miss Coleman
often said something like this to Margaret: “How fortunate
you are in having some things which these other
children cannot afford to have. How would you like
to play you are a fairy and get a new First Reader for
little Wilbur Tomlinson, who has no book, and just
leave it on his desk with his name in it, and not tell
him who gave it to him. I’ll help you pay for it, for
I want to get fun out of it too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Or, again, “Let’s think what we might plan to do
secretly for any child in the room who really needs
something we can give. We’ll be good fairies again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Margaret took a new interest in other children. She
soon began to like to go to school. She enjoyed playing
with the other pupils and loved and honored Miss
Coleman.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Displaying Fruit</div>

<p class='c007'>Florence Crane attended school in Michigan. She
lived on a fine fruit farm where during the fall one
variety of peaches, grapes or pears followed another
and when these had all been sold choice apples followed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_689'>689</span>in season. So it happened that choice fruit was always
a part of Florence’s lunch. This fruit was displayed
on her desk and tempted many a child’s eyes away
from school tasks. Miss Bush, the teacher, requested
all of the children to keep their lunches concealed
and away from their desks. Still at recess time Florence
had a little group of children around her watching
her eat her luscious fruit. Miss Bush could
scarcely endure the sight of the hungry eyes devouring
every bite with Florence.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day she was especially tired and without forethought
said, “Florence, you shall not bring another
piece of fruit to school unless you bring enough for all
of the girls.” Imagine Florence’s indignation which
was not much greater than that of her associates.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the girls discussed this together on the playground
a little later Florence said, “I’ve a right to
bring whatever I please t’ eat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ethel Green, spokesman for the rest, declared,
“Teacher’s crazy. We don’t want anybody to bring
us lunches. If we hain’t got enought to eat we won’t
ask her to give us anything.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The girls had talked about the matter until the
atmosphere of the school-room was that of slumbering
rebellion.</p>

<p class='c007'>That night when Florence told her parents what
Miss Bush said there was much indignation and a long
discussion which ended in a decision to have Mrs.
Crane visit Miss Bush at the schoolhouse next day.
On her way there Mrs. Crane stopped to discuss the
situation with Mrs. Green, whom Ethel had informed
of the previous day’s talk. Mrs. Green was very angry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_690'>690</span>and offered to go with Mrs. Crane to the schoolhouse.</p>

<p class='c007'>The situation was very awkward for Miss Bush.
She was reluctant to say in the presence of Mrs. Green
that the other girls were always hanging around
Florence watching her eat her fruit and yet she had
to justify herself in some way. The mothers took
advantage of Miss Bush’s embarrassment, assuming
that it showed guilt and even accusing her of giving
the command to Florence on the previous day in order
that she herself might be given fruit. The conference
ended with the remark from Mrs. Green, “If you’re
hungry yourself, say so, but don’t beg vittles for my
children.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Bush’s joy in her work in that school was
ended. The girls might have forgotten the incident
but the mothers whenever they met revived the feeling
of anger against Miss Bush.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Bush was too superficial in her original treatment
of this case. She had had ample time to think
out a workable plan that would have caused no friction.</p>

<p class='c007'>After having all food removed from the desks she
might have asked the pupils to find appropriate seats
in which to eat their lunches. After lunch time she
should have led the way to the playground where all
else than play would be easily forgotten.</p>

<p class='c007'>From time to time short talks on manners should
be given to the whole school.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_691'>691</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>It is inexcusable for a teacher to give angry or even
unpremeditated treatment to a case that has been
developing for some time. Miss Bush touched upon a
very serious question when she gave commands concerning
what the children had to eat in their lunches.
In her talks on manners the teacher can easily place
special emphasis upon such phases of the subject as
are most nearly related to the habits of her pupils.
These general remarks can hurt the feelings of no one,
since they are given to the entire school.</p>

<p class='c007'>The part that unselfishness plays in what is usually
termed good manners can thus be clearly brought out.
Some teachers ask their pupils to learn the following
couplet in this connection:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

<div class='sidenote'>Eating Candy</div>

<p class='c007'>Tommy Holbroke’s father kept a small candy store
in Brighton and Tommy often carried candy to school
with him. This he ate with a great show of enjoyment
in the presence of a group of onlookers. Miss Dean,
his teacher, noted the conditions and appreciated its
inevitably baneful effect upon Tommy’s disposition.
Accordingly she visited his mother and first told her of
Tommy’s sunny temper and studious habits. Then she
tactfully led the subject to the boy’s health and food.
In talking of the candy she said, “Of course we must
guard Tommy’s health and his disposition too.” Then
she explained that she greatly feared that his bringing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_692'>692</span>candy to school would make him selfish because of
course it enabled him to have and not share what he
knew others wanted. She suggested that Tommy be
given his candy directly after his meals and at no other
time. The double appeal in behalf of the child’s health
as well as his character caused the mother to follow
Miss Dean’s advice. Occasionally, however, on “special
days” or when the children had a “birthday
party,” Tommy’s mother gave him a bag of candy to
take to his teacher with the words, “Tell Miss Dean
to please give it to all the children.” So Tommy
learned, in time, the joy of sharing with others.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 127 (EIGHTH GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Selfish Play</div>

<p class='c007'>The grade schools in the suburbs of one of our largest
cities give special attention to outdoor play. They
even require that the children stay on the school
grounds at least fifteen minutes after the school proper
is closed, and play games there. They encourage the
playing of ball by the girls and are anxious to have
them interested in the game.</p>

<p class='c007'>In one of these schools the principal, Mr. Warren,
went to the eighth grade rooms and gave the girls a
talk on baseball. He advocated that the girls in each
eighth grade room elect by ballot a baseball team and
that these teams practice ball with the earnest expectation
of being able eventually to conquer any other
eighth grade team in the suburb. After school a ballot
was taken and those receiving the highest number
of votes were considered elected on the team.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those who failed to be elected felt, of course, various
degrees of disappointment and envy. Some proposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_693'>693</span>forming a scrub team of the left-overs. Others were
afraid that this would show the “team” that they
were jealous of them; whereas, they had been putting
on a brave front by saying to their classmates that
they would not have accepted a position on the team
even if they had been elected.</p>

<p class='c007'>The entire school grounds occupied about half a city
block. This space had to be shared with the boys and
girls in all the other grades. It naturally followed
that there was little space to be used by each room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Darnell’s eighth grade ball team girls were
anxious to bring fame to themselves as champion players.
Mr. Warren’s thrilling speech still rang in their
ears. His slogan, “We’ll beat ’em!” was passed from
lip to lip. As a result of this enthusiasm, this special
team wished to play ball at every intermission and
before and after school. When they played, the rest
of the girls in Miss Darnell’s room were obliged to
keep off the ground allotted to that room. The girls
who rebelled against being nothing but “fans” were
called “disloyal to their own team” or “green with
jealousy.” The play periods were no longer enjoyed
by all, but distinct factions arose, consisting of team
and “fans,” and as the team grew more and more determined
to use the grounds at every available minute
the “fans” became less and less enthusiastic in their
support.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Warren did wrong to deprive any pupil of a
right use of the playground or gymnasium.</p>

<p class='c007'>When teams are formed, limit the time they may use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_694'>694</span>the field and apparatus so as to accommodate those
who are not on the teams at some time during the day.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Warren’s prime motive in asking to have ball
teams elected was to have the girls take delight in
vigorous, outdoor sport. In that respect his plan was
ideal, but he failed to take into account in any way
whatsoever those children who were not on the team.
Children are quick to feel an injustice. Their usual
mode of reaction is either to resent the teacher’s action
or to be jealous of the favored ones. No plan should
be advocated or even tolerated that does not give reasonable
consideration to the rights and welfare of all
the pupils.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (EIGHTH GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Sharing Dances</div>

<p class='c007'>A new gymnasium had just been erected at Horton
and the principal, Mr. Bergen, was anxious to have
all get the benefit of it. The eighth grade girls under
Miss Vance were especially pleased with this fine play
room. One of their number, Stella Day, had been taking
lessons in dancing and promised to teach her
special friends the new steps. It so turned out that
Miss Vance herself was interested in these new dances
and enjoyed watching the lessons. But the majority
of the girls in her room cared nothing about dancing
and indeed if they had cared the “lessons” were not
at all open to them, since only eight of the twenty-one
girls were invited to take any part in this exercise.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Bergen had carefully arranged the gymnasium
program so that each room might use it every day.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_695'>695</span>The first time he watched Miss Vance’s pupils at
“gym” work he was surprised to find so few taking
the exercises and furthermore to see that the onlookers
were not even enjoying the watching of the dancers.
This led him to surmise that they did not take turns
in their exercises, otherwise the dejected look would
not have been seen on the faces of the observers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Bergen made a mental note of those who were
dancing and returned the next day to see if the same
girls were occupying the whole of the teacher’s attention.
Finding that such was the case he explained to
Miss Vance that all of her pupils must be really interested
in watching or actually engaged in every game
during the exercise period. Following his advice, Miss
Vance changed the exercise to games in which all could
take part, thus making a legitimate use of the gymnasium
period.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Taking the Best</div>

<p class='c007'>Elizabeth Dyer seemed to be naturally selfish. When
the classes were sent to do blackboard work she invariably
chose the place where the light was the best.
When the crayons were passed she took the unused
one. One of the new erasers was always in her hand.
When the class was called she always took the recitation
bench nearest the teacher, etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>Little Susan Dillman said to a group of girls on the
way home from school one evening,</p>

<p class='c007'>“Girls, I’m going to tell Bess Dyer what I think
of her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no, you don’t dare,” said the other girls.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ll see,” said Susan.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_696'>696</span>That night Susan thought out her plan. She invited
three of her closest friends to her home the next evening
and disclosed her plan. She had composed this
bit of rhyme:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Just guess if you can</div>
      <div class='line'>What girl in our class</div>
      <div class='line'>Appropriates always the best,</div>
      <div class='line'>Be it crayon or book,</div>
      <div class='line'>By hook or by crook</div>
      <div class='line'>She’ll beat to it all of the rest.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Now girls, here in the library is Sam’s typewriter.
Let’s each write a part of this so we can all say we
didn’t write it and lay it on Elizabeth’s desk tomorrow.”
All were agreed, so one after another took a
turn at writing. After many copies were spoiled they
finally wrote one that pleased them. Each took a turn
at addressing the envelope. When it was sealed they
said, “E-ne me-ne mi-ne mo,” etc., to find out who
was to place this on Elizabeth’s desk. The lot fell to
Lulu Miller, but she would do it only on condition that
Sue go with her and help her place it. The next morning
the girls went to school as soon as the doors were
opened. They found nobody in the assembly room, so
they opened Elizabeth’s geometry text at that day’s
lesson. Each took hold of one corner of the envelope
and placed it in the book. Then they returned the
book to the desk and went into the history room where
they diligently studied the maps until school opened.</p>

<p class='c007'>After opening exercises the four guilty girls watched
from a corner of their eyes to see Elizabeth get her missive.
Susan saw her take out the letter, open it and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_697'>697</span>blush scarlet, while she wiped away tears of vexation.
Soon Elizabeth with letter in hand walked up to Mr.
Davidson’s desk and talked to him a few minutes.
When she came away again she didn’t have the letter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The girls had not counted upon this turn of affairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before school closed Mr. Davidson asked who put
the note in Elizabeth’s geometry. Nobody answered.
He then questioned everybody one at a time and each
answered “No” to the question. “Did you put it
there?” Susan and Lulu tried to think they told the
truth because they neither of them did it alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Davidson said, “All right, we’ll stay right here
till we find out the guilty party.” Some laughed,
others pouted and a few who drove to school from the
country looked worried. Mr. Davidson said, “Somebody
in this room knows who did that. I’m sorry to
think anybody is mean enough to keep all of his schoolmates
in because he will not tell the truth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Still nobody confessed. Mr. Davidson waited and
scolded by turns until dusk, all to no purpose. The
girls’ fear of exposure, to say nothing of confession,
grew greater with every speech he made. He finally
dismissed the school, after saying that he would find
the culprit and suspend him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Daily Mr. Davidson referred publicly to the note
and made threats as to what he would do with the
guilty one. These frequent references to the affair
helped Elizabeth to remember her fault and practically
cured her of it. But the guilty ones were never found
out and Mr. Davidson had four pupils whose joy and
efficiency in school work were greatly diminished.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_698'>698</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>When you see that a pupil is truly selfish begin at
once to treat him. First find out, if possible, how
this trait was developed and then begin to correct the
false notions. Say to the selfish one, “I want you to
study the pupils of this room this week, and tell me
of all the unselfish deeds done that you can make
note of, and why you think them unselfish.” Of course,
other pupils will be given similar topics and the reports,
as well as the original requests, will be made
in public. These character studies may be connected
with literature in place of the fictitious personalities
which are often studied.</p>

<p class='c007'>When wishing to find the writer of a note go to work
at it privately. Having once made a threat do not
lightly disregard it. Do not give over to your pupils
matters of discipline which you should attend to
yourself.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Davidson doubtless knew that Elizabeth was
selfish, but took no measures to correct the fault. Some
teachers say they are not employed as character builders
but only as instructors in secular matters. The
truth is, however, that they cannot escape instructing
in morals. Elizabeth was growing more selfish. The
question as to whether character grows during school
life is settled. Pupils do change in character. The
teacher has no choice. He either confirms or breaks
up bad habits. The principle of substitution enables
the selfish pupil to grow less selfish by the study and
admiration of unselfish pupils and adults. It is in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_699'>699</span>order to call forth this admiration that the student
is asked to tell why he names certain acts unselfish.</p>

<p class='c007'>Teachers make mistakes often by publicly announcing
a misdemeanor about which there would otherwise
be little known. Cases where immediate danger does
not threaten should not be made public. Private inquiry
is always much more fruitful of good results.
Public confession is especially hard. Furthermore,
the sidetracking of legitimate school interests by much
discussion of misdemeanors can be minimized by letting
as few persons as possible know about the wrong
deed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Threats that are not carried out weaken the teacher’s
control.</p>

<p class='c007'>Patient study and planning will show the teacher
a way to cure selfishness. By judicious observation a
teacher can discover attitudes taken toward a pupil
by his schoolmates and these will be of great value
to him in any attempt at corrective measures.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is doubtless true that the schoolmates often develop
a wise and effective cure for some wrong trait
or attitude. In such cases they may be permitted to
carry out their program, without the connivance of
the teacher. But a close examination of the conditions
is needful, so that neglect of unformed characters
may not be appropriately charged against a
teacher.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Earl Foley was fifteen years old when he entered
high school and came under the control of its principal,
Mr. Mullendore.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_700'>700</span>Earl was large, with a round face, thick lips, a big
mouth and a too ready smile. He was very active and
learned easily, but was unmannerly and above all,
selfish. He invariably selected the best for himself,
stood between others and the teacher, gave his views
unsought, and in many little ways annoyed his teachers
and companions.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Selfish Manners</div>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Mullendore discovered that the boy simply
needed teaching, so he decided that in his private talks
with Earl he would use illustrations easily understood.
He asked Earl one day what famous person he admired
above all others. Finding the man to be Lincoln,
Mr. Mullendore talked of Lincoln’s unselfishness
and humility and even asked Earl what kind of pencil
he thought Lincoln would have taken if passed a
box containing one good pencil, and the others second
grade, Lincoln knowing, meanwhile, that all would
be used by his classmates. Mr. Mullendore talked
of Earl’s work on the farm and asked him to recall
the practice of pigs, cattle and fowls in getting their
share of food. He asked Earl to study out the cause
for the development of unselfishness in the human
race.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this was said without a single reference to
Earl’s own traits. It seemed a part of the study of
Lincoln. Earl was not slow to apply the suggestions
of the lesson, however, and before many months had
passed he was one of the most unselfish pupils in the
high school.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) <i>Jealousy.</i> Some one has truly said, “In jealousy
there is more self-love than love.” It is an attitude
which develops early, however. Even very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_701'>701</span>young children will sometimes destroy an object
rather than have it fall into the hands of another. As
a rule the smaller the number of individuals in competition
and the narrower the range of their interests
the more intense will be the jealousy between
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The teacher’s problems are complicated by jealousies
in two ways: (1) by a spirit of unkindly rivalry
among patrons of the school, a feeling which is sure
to be reflected in the attitudes of the pupils toward
each other, and (2) by a spirit of jealousy arising
among and limited to the pupils themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first type has been treated incidentally in other
parts of Practical School Discipline and need not be
further dealt with here. The second type, fortunately,
is not a very common cause of trouble in the
well ordered school-room, but it is a fault so harmful
to the child himself and in adult life, so harmful to
all who come within its blighting influence, that it
can not be too carefully watched and checked in its
early development.</p>

<p class='c007'>During adolescence and afterwards, jealous attitudes
arise mainly out of sports and out of competition
for sex recognition and appreciation. Jealousy
breeds an angry resentment toward a person who
holds or seems likely to acquire one’s property or
personal privilege. It embraces a feeling of fear and
a sense of helplessness in the face of the aggressor. It
develops an enlarged appreciation of the treasures
involved and a disposition to care for them by violence,
or if defence is useless, to destroy them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jealousy, envy, rivalry and covetousness are only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_702'>702</span>varying forms of the same anti-social attitude of
selfishness. Tact and patience on the part of parent
and teacher and the judicious application of the Five
Fundamental Principles will uproot them all in time.</p>

were fashionable, dainty and immaculate, her curls
always becomingly arranged. Altogether she was such
a child as one delights to see, one who brought a smile
to the faces of almost all whom she met, strangers as
well as friends. As she entered the third grade school-room
for the first time, Miss Elliot, the teacher, exclaimed,
“What a darling!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Among other pupils in the room was Caroline Hillis,
a timid little girl with a solemn, little old-looking
face. Her language was crude, her manner unpolished
and her dresses ill-fitting, coarse and faded. She was
the eldest of four children and long before she reached
the third grade was considered by her mother too big
to be kissed and petted.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Jealous of Playmate</div>

<p class='c007'>How Caroline watched Julia! at first with admiration
only. But as the days went by her attitude gradually
changed to jealousy. Julia always knew her lessons.
Julia’s language was always correct. Julia
never slammed doors or walked noisily, and oh, most
enviable privilege of all, Julia often stood near Miss
Elliot as she sat at her desk and put her arm around
the teacher’s neck. At such times Miss Elliot smiled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_703'>703</span>at Julia in an intimate way. How much Caroline
would give to be able to stand there thus and show her
love for Miss Elliot in the same way but she simply
could not. Little did Miss Elliot think that Caroline
had planned to do just that very thing. As Caroline
lay in bed before she went to sleep she thought, “Now,
tomorrow I’ll ask Miss Elliot how to work a problem
and I’ll stand by her and put my arm around her neck,
just as Julia does and Miss Elliot will look at me just
as she does at Julia.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But alas! just as Caroline tremblingly approached
Miss Elliot, thinking to carry out her plan, the
teacher arose to discover the location of a mild
disturbance in the back of the room and Caroline
in confusion told her errand and went back to her seat
where she shyly brushed aside a few stray tears. With
heroic courage she decided to try it again and this
time she found Miss Elliot seated, but before Caroline
reached her she said hurriedly, “What is it, Caroline?”
with no smile and in such a matter-of-fact voice
that Caroline stammered her question before she really
reached Miss Elliot’s side. It was of no use. She
didn’t believe Miss Elliot liked her as well as she did
Julia. Whereas Miss Elliot soliloquized, “What an
awkward, timid, unlovable child Caroline is today, she
seemed afraid of me. I know the rest of the children
like me. I can’t pet her in order to win her confidence.
I’ve got to treat them all alike.” Because Caroline
regarded her teacher with such sad eyes, the idea grew
in Miss Elliot’s mind that Caroline disliked her.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Caroline’s mind the thought persisted that Julia
was favored by everybody. She began to think of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_704'>704</span>Julia’s faults. As she sought them earnestly she found
them: Julia always talked too much, she liked too well
to speak of her brother Eugene who was in college,
she talked of Miss Elliot as if she owned her.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day a little girl spoke of her doll, another of a
doll’s party and soon Julia said, “Oh, girls, let’s all
bring a doll tomorrow and have a dolls’ party at recess!
Wouldn’t that be fun?” All agreed but Caroline, who
was on the edge of the group. Her downcast face was
unnoticed. The truth is that Caroline’s only doll was
badly soiled and somewhat dismembered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Julia easily gained the encouragement of Miss Elliot
in her plan for the next day. Some of the girls went
early with their dolls. Julia’s was a cunning little
character doll. Caroline brought none. She imagined
that she could hear Miss Elliot say, “How cunning!”
as she looked at Julia’s doll, and then Julia and the
teacher would exchange that intimate smile; Caroline
would be the only one who had no doll. She never
could have Miss Elliot’s approval.</p>

<p class='c007'>While Caroline was feeling rather than thinking all
this Julia said, “Let’s lay all our dolls on Miss Elliot’s
desk and then when she comes have her guess which
one belongs to which girl.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That will be fun,” said the others, so it was quickly
done. Caroline stood at a little distance feeling left
out of the fun.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let’s go and meet Miss Elliot,” said Julia, “and
tell her about it. Soon all the girls but Caroline were
out of the room and starting down the street.</p>

<p class='c007'>Caroline presently said to herself, “I’ll hide her
doll and then I guess Miss Elliot can’t brag about it.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_705'>705</span>She cast her eyes about the room for a hiding place.
There stood the piano! Mrs. Fitzhugh had said yesterday
that she kept her ring in the piano. Hastily
grabbing up Julia’s doll Caroline stood upon the piano
bench and lifting the lid of the upright piano, laid the
doll inside upon the hammers, closed the lid and
jumped down to the floor just in time to gain a
place by the window before the girls and Miss Elliot
came in.</p>

<p class='c007'>They led Miss Elliot to her desk, having already told
her what they wanted her to do. Almost immediately
they noticed that Julia’s doll was gone. Caroline, now
remorseful and silent, was questioned. She said she
knew nothing about it. The girls sought everywhere
for the doll until school time, Caroline helping them
look into desks and on closet shelves.</p>

<p class='c007'>Caroline, growing more and more remorseful as one
girl after another pitied Julia, resolved to return to the
room at noon time, when everybody was out of the
room, and put the doll on Julia’s desk.</p>

<p class='c007'>Imagine Caroline’s dismay when the piano was
found out of order by Miss Elliot as soon as she started
to play the opening song.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Elliot opened the piano lid and gave a little
start. There was the lost doll! Julia rushed for it
and cuddled it. Molly said aloud,
“How did it get there?” Caroline hung her head
and Miss Elliot looked very grave.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Caroline, come here,” she said. “Why did you
put Julia’s doll into the piano?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know,” said Caroline, with a degree of
truth.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_706'>706</span>“It is a marvel that it isn’t broken. I’ll have to
whip you for that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Taking a strap kept for the purpose Miss Elliot
explained to Caroline that she had lied as well as concealed
the doll with a probable hope of stealing it later.
She then gave the child a severe whipping. Caroline
dumbly felt that she was misjudged and yet could not
explain why, even to herself.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Elliot should have satisfied herself fully as to
the motive underlying Caroline’s action before punishing
her. Always delay a punishment until you have
found the real cause of the misdemeanor.</p>

<p class='c007'>When a child shows a tendency to withdraw from
group activities take special pains to draw him into
the play circle. Take the timid child by the hand
rather than the one who rushes to you. Say to the
child who shrinks back into her corner, “We need one
more little girl here.” Hold out your hand toward
her as you speak. The gesture will reinforce the words,
and be to the child a suggestion of welcome into the
group.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>There is no more faulty method of discipline than
that of severely punishing a child for some outbreak
against moral or school law before a hearing has been
given him; not merely giving a chance to confess his
wrong, but going to the bottom of the matter and finding,
if possible, the underlying motive or instinct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_707'>707</span>which led up to the outbreak. Skillful questioning
ought to bring this out.</p>

<p class='c007'>Very often the slow and timid child is longing for
your friendship but does not know how to show his
desire. Whether or not he is conscious of needing your
aid, he, nevertheless, does need it.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (SIXTH GRADE)</h4>

<p class='c016'>June Dacey was a frail city girl whose health was
such that her parents feared to send her to the public
schools in New York. One September morning June’s
father said to her: “June, how would you like to spend
a year in the country and attend school with your
cousins?”</p>

<p class='c007'>June thought it would be, “Just fine!” and Mr.
Dacey was not long in arranging with his brother in
Massachusetts to receive June into his home and to
see her well started in the country school.</p>

<p class='c007'>All went well until June’s cousin Carrie Dacey began
to show signs of jealousy toward June. The two
girls were just of an age, but Carrie was an unusually
vigorous, strong, healthy girl with double the amount
of endurance possessed by June. As a consequence the
two girls received very different treatment by their
elders and even in a half unconscious way by the
other children who were, indeed, somewhat overawed
by June’s pretty clothes and refined manners.</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, yes! of course June can have everything and I
can’t have anything,” said Carrie one day in a fit of
petulance. “She has all the nice clothes and I have to
wear this old thing. She can ride to the picnic while
I have to walk. The teacher is always doing things for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_708'>708</span>her and nobody ever does anything for me. At home
it’s just the same way, June gets all the attention.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Scott, the teacher, happened to overhear the
remark, although it was not intended for her, and was
thereby made conscious of the ill-will that was springing
up between the two girls. She had had no desire
to show partiality in any way toward June but only
to protect the frail girl from too fatiguing sport. Now
she said to herself, “This won’t do! We shall have a
tragedy here soon! I must think out some plan to overcome
this feeling between the two cousins.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It so happened that the children had for their reading
lesson “The Story of the Twins.” The story was
full of activity and fun and mischief and the children
liked it. Miss Scott had promised the class that when
they could read it very well they might dramatize it
some day.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You two girls who are just of an age must be our
twins,” said Miss Scott, “the other children may take
the other parts. Mary and Jane, come help me make
this crepe paper into costumes for ‘the twins.’ They
must dress just alike.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The children caught the idea, and, just as Miss Scott
intended they should do, immediately nicknamed the
two girls “The Twins.” Miss Scott strengthened the
tendency still further by saying occasionally, in a playful
way, “Will the twins pass the paint boxes for us?”
“Will the twins collect the pencils?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Carrie was soon quite cured of her jealous complainings.
Through suggestion, the feeling of coöperation
and comradeship had been substituted for the selfish
emotion of jealousy, and in thus being linked together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_709'>709</span>in school duties and sports, in a way, too, that emphasized
the relation of equality, the two children soon
became firm friends.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 130 (EIGHTH GRADE)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Wendell Smith was a son of Dr. Smith, one of the
most influential men in the village. He was handsome,
well-dressed, well-mannered and very intelligent. He
had delightful books, mechanical and constructive toys,
a bicycle, a watch, and now a few days after he entered
the fourth grade his father gave him a pony and carriage
for a birthday present.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Jealous of “Rich Boy”</div>

<p class='c007'>Mark Hazard was in the same grade at school. Their
teacher was Miss Hosiner. Mark was a wide-awake
boy who was often in mischief. He was coarse in his
speech and manners. He criticized adversely every
one of Wendell’s possessions and was always glad
when for any reason Wendell failed to recite well.
When the boys played, Mark would say: “Don’t ask
Wendell to come, he might get his clothes dirty.”
When Wendell missed the word “giraffe” Mark whispered
sibilantly, “He can spell ‘pony’; that’s all the
animal he knows.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Hosiner knew that Mark disliked Wendell and
felt sure that jealousy was at the bottom of his sneers
and coarse remarks, but she didn’t know how to bring
about a change.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a pool of muddy water near the back
door after every rain. This was spanned by a plank
over which the children walked to the playground.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day Mark and Wendell were both on the plank
when Mark deftly tripped Wendell, who fell splash into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_710'>710</span>the muddy water. Had Mark used common courtesy
Wendell would doubtless have laughed at his own
plight, but when he looked up to see Mark’s sneer as he
said sarcastically, “Now you’re some dolled up ain’t
you?” he said, “Mark Hazard, you’ve got to smart
for this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Hosiner had seen it all from the window and
understood the situation perfectly. She went to the
door and said, “Wendell, you may go home and change
your clothes; Mark, you may go in and take your seat
and you may have all of your intermissions alone for a
week. As soon as you come in the morning, and at
noon, you may take your seat at once. I will allow
you a separate time for your recess from that of pupils
who know how to behave toward each other. Since
you can’t act decently toward other boys, you may play
by yourself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As the group separated Mark shook his fist at Miss
Hosiner’s retreating back and openly made an ugly
face at Wendell.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not only during the week of his punishment but
throughout the year he showed insolence toward Miss
Hosiner and distinct dislike for Wendell.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Go privately to the boy of whom one or more of the
pupils are jealous and tell him how to treat the jealous
ones. In the above instance say to Wendell as soon as
you first observe that Mark is jealous of him, “I have
observed that Mark is not friendly with you. I know
you would be much happier to have his friendship.
He is not sure that you want to be friends and since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_711'>711</span>you have more to give him by becoming friends than
he can give you I can’t blame him much for wanting
you to make the start.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If one man had $1,000 to put into business and
another $10,000, you couldn’t expect the man with the
$1,000 to have audacity enough to ask the $10,000 man
to go into partnership with him, but how glad he’d be
if the richer man should invite him to become a partner
in his business.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, that’s just the way it is with you and Mark.
You’ll have to make him see that you really want to
be friends before he can believe that it is so. I heard
one of the boys say that you are going to give them
all a ride in turn in your new pony carriage. If I
were you I would ask Mark to be the first one. I’d
ask him first to share all of my good things, because
he suffers most for the things that you have. That’s
what makes him feel out of sorts because he can’t
have them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It takes more skill to be a gracious receiver than
to be a gracious giver, so don’t feel offended if Mark
doesn’t know how to act at first. Keep on trying to
show him that you like him until you succeed.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>The question of inequality so pitifully and constantly
understood by many sensitive children is often
the cause of jealousy that grows until it becomes a
menace to peace in a school. This feeling should be
checked as soon as it appears. Punishing the one who
is jealous only makes him entertain a feeling of resentment
toward both the teacher and the one who is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_712'>712</span>envied by him. The right interchange of feeling can
be secured only by assisting the more favored pupil
to show genuine friendship for the one who is jealous.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (FOURTH GRADE)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Emeline Carlisle was a little girl who talked about
the maid, the cook and the nurse at their house, of the
company they had, the vacations they spent and the
clerks in “father’s store.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Jessie Dodge was a child of a poor but refined widow
who, with extreme difficulty, was able to provide sufficient
clothing and food for her.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Jealous of “Rich Girl”</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Dunlap, the teacher in the fourth grade, saw
that Jessie was destined to become jealous of Emeline.
So she pointed out to Emeline from time to time the
superior gifts and traits of Jessie. She would say:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Jessie Dodge is such a refined girl. She knows
how to reply whenever she is spoken to. I think the
girls who are her special friends are fortunate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She appointed these two girls to do tasks together,
saying, “Jessie and Emeline may work together on
the fifth problem, Emeline writes well and Jesse thinks
well. They will make good companions for this work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By such handling of the situation, Emeline and
Jessie became good friends.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 131 (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<p class='c016'>A western college gave a high school tournament
every spring. Surrounding high schools were invited
to assemble with their competing candidates for athletic
contests in the afternoon, followed by reading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_713'>713</span>and oratorical contests that night. Prizes were given
to the winners either by the college or individuals
in the college town.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Jealousy Between Schools</div>

<p class='c007'>This tournament was one of the big events of the
year for the high schools. They trained for it from
September till May. The victors were lionized in the
typically enthusiastic high school manner, while the
citizens of the towns in which the schools were located
talked of the event for weeks and knew and honored
not only the schools but the individuals who had won
the prizes.</p>

<p class='c007'>For two years Eastman pupils had won in athletics,
and now (1915) they were reputed to have an excellent
reader who was going up to the oratorical contest.
The slogan in more than one school had been
“Beat Eastman.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The meet occurred on Friday. On Thursday evening
Principal MacKenzie of Dwight said to his contestants,
“I believe we’ll win tomorrow. I believe we
have the kind of muscles and brains that will ‘Beat
Eastman.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hurra-a-a!” sang out the boys—all but one, John
Nealy.</p>

<p class='c007'>An inscrutable look had come into his eyes when
Mr. MacKenzie uttered the words, “Beat Eastman,”
and he had been too intently following up some idea
to join in the shout.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the way to the college town the next morning
he said to his colleagues, “Boys, I’ve thought of a
way to beat Eastman.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How?” they said, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll take the boys to a ‘feed’ at noon. We’ll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_714'>714</span>order everything eatable for their runner and jumper
and we’ll get them so filled up that they can’t make
good.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But will they go with us?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure, they’ll go. Their runner, Fernald, is a good
friend of mine.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We won’t dare overeat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can’t we just pretend we’re eating everything?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The details were arranged.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, Harmon Walsh, one of the Dwight boys,
had a fine, upright character and he could not be party
to this foolish scheme of John’s. He finally decided
to tell Mr. MacKenzie about it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The latter, astonished, took the Dwight boys under
his special care, forbade their inviting anybody to
lunch with them, and never left them until they were
on the athletic field.</p>

<p class='c007'>That year Eastman came out second and Dwight
third.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they returned to Dwight, Mr. MacKenzie
called John into his office and inquired why he had
proposed his “lunch scheme” on the way to the meet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m sick and tired of hearing Eastman’s praises,”
said John. “I’d do anything to beat them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thereupon Prof. MacKenzie talked so harshly to
John on the subject of jealousy that he quit school, as
he had begged to do before. So he missed getting his
high school education because his teacher was not
able to cultivate in him a spirit of competition without
jealousy and unfortunately was unable to handle
properly a case of jealousy when it appeared.</p>

<p class='c016'>In dealing with inter-high school competitive programs
talk much about the good qualities of your
school’s opponents. Secure personal favorable items

Talk on such themes as, “I’d rather be

<p class='c016'>The dividing line between legitimate ambition to
win for one’s school and jealousy of a winning opponent
is hard to fix ofttimes. High school students
should be drilled against personal antagonism and
mean advantage by the principal, who should always
laud the clean, fair, open game.</p>

<p class='c016'>The big, final basket ball game between Danvers
and Winfield high schools would determine which was
the best team in the state. Prof. Beatty of Danvers
wrote to Prof. Ryland of Winfield and said, among
other things:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Appreciating Opponents</div>

<p class='c007'>“Kindly write me a few words about each boy on

town boys? What is the favorite study of each? What
does each expect to do when he gets out of high school?
What do you consider the finest trait of each?</p>

<p class='c007'>When the answer to this letter came, the Danvers
boys read it eagerly and later met the Winfield boys
<span class='pageno' id='Page_716'>716</span>as friends. Not a hint of jealousy was shown by
Danvers when Winfield won.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION 2 (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Occasionally, a student overworks in the effort to
secure the highest place in the teacher’s appreciation.
In a certain high school the history teacher had two
boys in her class in modern history who were rivals
for first place.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Jealous of Scholarship</div>

<p class='c007'>One belonged to a wealthy family and had every
help and encouragement; the other was away from
home and working his way through school. It was
the latter boy who worried his teacher. He was up
early in the morning and late at night attending to
furnaces in winter, gardening and cleaning in the
spring; and after these exertions he read carefully
all the references given, lest Charles Schofield should
do better work than he. Of course this soon told on
his health, but he kept doggedly at his heavy tasks.
When he grew so listless that he had to rouse himself
with a visible effort to recite, Miss Van Leer kept him
one day after class for a talk.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You mustn’t think of trying to keep up with
Charles Schofield,” she said firmly. “Why, he has
nothing to do but eat and sleep and take a little exercise
and study.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know that. But you said last term that he did
the best work in the class, and I resolved that he
shouldn’t do the best this term, just because he has a
big library at home and all the time in the world. You
know I want to show you what I can do, Miss Van
Leer.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_717'>717</span>“I want you now, Ben, to show me how much common

for a fortnight.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And hear him rattle off reams from Adams and
all the rest of them? Not I! You would think me
a piker, for all you say.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you do it for me—as a personal favor?”
Miss Van Leer was forced finally to put her wish on a
personal basis. This succeeded where all appeal to
self-interest had failed.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) <i>Cliques and snobbishness.</i> One phase of this
subject, that of the ringleader, will be treated under
the heading “Regulative Instincts.” At the present
time the gregarious aspect, or the tendency of young
people to join together in little bands, will be noticed
chiefly. Such a tendency is, of course, only indirectly
harmful. It is both social and anti-social—social because
of the impulse toward companionship, anti-social
because of the selfishness that excludes from the social
group all except a few chosen favorites.</p>

at recess. Unwholesome gossip was the result. It
remained for Miss Sayre, who took charge of the room
the next year, to break down the barriers. She, too,
failed, but for another reason.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Sayre called these four girls to her one day
after school, when they were in a hurry to go home,
and gave them some good advice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You girls seem to run off by yourselves and not
to play with the others. I want to know why.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, we don’t like their games. They always play
such silly games. The girls in high school don’t do
things like that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you aren’t high school girls—you are just
little girls of the sixth grade. Drop that nonsense.
I want you to break up this cliquing and moping
around and act like girls. Now, do you understand?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” in a chorus. But nothing came of it.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Instead of a direct attack, draw these girls into
activities that require them to act in close coöperation
with other girls. Try committee work.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gladys is sick with pneumonia. She can’t come
to school for two weeks yet. I want to appoint a committee
of two to call on her and take her some flowers.
I’m going to appoint Eva and Annette for this
work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Be sure to make combinations that promise enough
congeniality to provide at least a temporary friendship.
Repeat the process very frequently, yet avoid
disclosing a purpose to disrupt the friendship of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_719'>719</span>chums, for that will excite antagonism and so spoil the
whole plan.</p>

<p class='c007'>Children are very jealous of their friendship, and
delicate handling is needed in order that no real injustice
may be done them. Close friendship is usually
of great value and the growth of attachments between
children of the same sex is to be fostered.</p>

<p class='c007'>The danger is in settling into grooves of thought
that cramp the mind and improverish it for lack of
wide association. It is very clear that the more human
beings a person knows, the broader will be his personality
and the richer his information. Hence, teachers
are everywhere duty bound to democratize the life of
their charges.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADES)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Misses Phelps and Bender took a wise course in
curing the fifth and sixth graders under their charge,
of snobbishness. They combined forces and went into
flower gardening on a small scale. A plot of ground
was procured and the children grouped by pairs according
to an inflexible rule adopted at the very start.
There were several motives behind this project, but
we need consider only this one point.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Gardening in Pairs</div>

<p class='c007'>To insure a genuinely democratic spirit, two pairs
were assigned each day for work in the flower garden.
Boys were paired with boys and girls with girls; there
were usually four children at the garden, each day,
rain or shine, if not to work, at least to note conditions
and report to their teachers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the girls resented slightly the comrades
<span class='pageno' id='Page_720'>720</span>selected for them, but no real insult was perpetrated
by the assignments made.</p>

<p class='c007'>The teachers took turns in sharing the responsibility
for management, except when wishing advice on cutting
and giving flowers, then all the pupils went to
Miss Phelps.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fifty pupils took part in the venture. It solved
several social school problems and created a fine spirit
of fraternalism among children of varied social
standings.</p>

<p class='c007'>When young people reach the high school age, the
period in which all the changes of adolescence are most
actively going on, they sometimes develop a tendency
to form clubs and secret societies which is often disastrous
to school discipline. When the clique evil is fully
developed, snobbishness and false standards run rife.</p>

<p class='c007'>There must be democracy in the school if the best
results are to be obtained, and the clique spirit may
work great havoc, especially in a small high school
where a well-defined group or clique is necessarily
very conspicuous.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 133 (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Sororities</div>

<p class='c007'>A high school of about 150 pupils in a prosperous
little western town became afflicted with the clique disease.
Margaret Hancock, the daughter of one of the
town’s most prominent citizens and rather a spoiled
child at home, returned from a winter spent in a southern
city, where she had gone to a large high school
and had been admitted to one of the numerous sororities
there. She came back thoroughly imbued with
the ideals of the southern high school, which was in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_721'>721</span>the wealthy, aristocratic part of the city and attended
by girls who expected to become debutantes in a few
years and make “society” their career. This southern
high school was a large one and the clique spirit was
not so harmful because there were several such groups
to offset each other and the pupils were, on the whole,
of the same social class.</p>

<p class='c007'>Back in her home town again, Margaret succeeded
in organizing a sorority before the first month of the
school year had passed. She included in her secret
society the girls whom she thought the “nicest” in the
school. These girls were the ones who most nearly
approached the prospective belles of the southern high
school in type—the girls with the most money and
the prettiest clothes, the ones whose parents were frequent
visitors in Margaret’s home. This clique or
sorority included about twenty pupils in its membership
and, needless to say, in a school of that size was
quite out of place.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not long before the boys followed the example
set by the girls and formed a secret club of limited
membership, and then how the two organizations did
lord it over the rest of the school!</p>

<p class='c007'>Boys who had come in from the country and worked
for their board in order to get a high school education
were looked down upon and made to feel ashamed
of their rural origin and their manner of life. Girls
whose clothes were not so fine or so numerous as those
of Margaret’s friends were hurt to the quick by the
sneers of their classmates and by being left out when
invitations to little dances and home parties were
being given out.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_722'>722</span>The two clubs soon managed things so that all the
class officers were from among their members and all
school functions were under their management. The
school became not a democracy, but an aristocracy of
the narrowest variety.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were so many club functions and good times
that school work suffered and these affairs had to be
talked over so extensively, by those who had and had
not been present alike, that there was more trouble
than ever before about whispering and note-writing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several of the pupils who had been neglected and
left entirely out of the social whirl lost interest in
school altogether and dropped out.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was thus that the clique spirit upset the morale
of the whole school and lowered the quality of the
work many degrees.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>The wise teacher will emphasize the school spirit,
or even class spirit, in dealing with situations involving
the clique evil. Try to make the snobbish ones
forget their exclusiveness in their interest in athletics
or other contests in which the <i>best</i> man or team wins
and in which the <i>whole</i> school is the party to gain or
lose by the outcome.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a last resort, the parents of the ringleaders in
the cliques should be appealed to, to make their offspring
see the folly and the falseness of the standards
they are setting up, for snobbish children have generally
been more or less encouraged in their snobbish
tendencies at home.</p>

<div>

  <h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Children of all grades do their best work when they
have interest and enthusiasm for the work and the
school. School spirit can be carried to extremes, but
in moderation it should be encouraged. The clique
evil needs careful, tactful treatment, for the suppression
of school societies sometimes leads to the formation
of secret organizations imbued with all the mystery
and solemnity of the adults’ lodge, which are
much harder to eradicate than the open, above-board
kind, and seem to be many times more attractive to
the adolescent mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Adolescence is the sensitive age, the age when small
slights cut deepest and pride is most easily wounded,
as well as the period when secrets and mystery are
most alluring. It is positively cruel for the young
people of a school to make their classmates suffer as
they have the power to do, by organizing good times
and meetings from which the majority of the school
are excluded.</p>

<p class='c007'>The clique evil is much more likely to develop into
serious proportions in a small school of a few hundred
than in a large one of a thousand or more.</p>

<p class='c007'>Children, as well as adults, choose for friends persons
of the same or similar tastes, but in a small school
the grouping of these kindred spirits into an exclusive
organization is particularly bad, because there are usually
not enough other pupils with the spirit and initiative
to form rival organizations; there is usually one
clique only, which excludes the majority of the school
from its ranks, instead of several which offset each
other.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>The clique spirit is met with in many other places
besides the school-room.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Stocking Factory</div>

<p class='c007'>The manager of a stocking factory found one group
of girls among his operatives making the days and
nights miserable for the others in his employ. They
made loud and unpleasant remarks about other girls
in the dressing-room, were rude at all times to those
not of their group, and, by intimidation, forced the
foreman to give them the advantage when there was
one to be given.</p>

<p class='c007'>Things finally came to such a pass that no girl whom
the clique disliked could be induced to work in the
factory, so unpleasant did the clique make it for her.</p>

<p class='c007'>The manager studied the situation long and earnestly
when he realized how serious it was, and finally
hit upon the scheme of providing a gymnasium for his
women operatives. He hired a trained social worker,
who was also a gymnasium teacher. She developed
team work and the spirit of good sportsmanship in
the course of a year’s work in gymnastic classes and
athletics, but it was largely the influence of her own
personality and the soundness of her teaching and
example that worked the change.</p>

<p class='c007'>The clique spirit vanished as the result of her efforts.
The manager of the factory had realized the loss he
was suffering in the lessened efficiency of his workers;
this loss was remedied only after the company had
expended much money.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>School Clubs</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Reynolds, teacher of the senior year high
school, had long foreseen the trend of the social impulse
in the Lewiston School. Such notices on the
blackboard of the assembly room as “Meeting of the
Adelphian Society this afternoon,” and “L. A. C.
business meeting tonight,” stood as evidence that the
club idea was growing into prominence.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the subject was brought up at faculty meeting,
Miss Reynolds voiced her opinion as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“This club idea is only a natural one with children.
They get their incentives from the social organization
at home. Mother belongs to the Mothers’ club or
literary society; Father belongs to the Manufacturers’
Association or Industrial League. It seems to me the
only solution is to provide as many opportunities as
possible for outlets for this social instinct. It is our
place to encourage the formation of societies along
literary, social and athletic lines.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Heated discussion followed. A vote was taken on
the motion: “We will encourage the formation of
literary, social and athletic clubs,” with the result that
it was carried.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it was soon markedly noticeable that the clubs
drew finer social distinctions until the whole atmosphere
of the school was undermined by a spirit of
snobbishness, ill-feelings and entire lack of coöperation
between pupil and teacher.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Allow no organizations to be formed without the
approval of the faculty. When officially recognized,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_726'>726</span>see that the society elects an advisory board which
shall consist of two teachers, two or more pupils, who
shall be the officers of the society, and the principal of
the school, who shall act as honorary member. This
board is to act as a “court of appeal” in the decision
of questions which concern the activities of the organization.
It is in no sense to be a dictatorial power.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Reynolds had the right idea when she encouraged
the formation of school organizations, but she
failed to realize that the activities of such societies
should be tactfully supervised by teacher and principal,
under the direction of leaders who have the
interests of the society at heart and who will lend their
good judgment to its best development; such an organization
may be depended upon as a standard of
conduct on all questions which affect the name of the
school. Unguided organizations are the source of
many of the evil tendencies in school life.</p>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Athletic Associations</div>

<p class='c007'>When Mr. McDaniels, the physical director of the
Edgeville High School, advised the boys that their
games would be better organized and they would be
more certain of help from the faculty if they formed
an athletic association, they decided immediately to
organize. Accordingly, a meeting was called for the
afternoon, of all the boys who were interested in athletics.
As might be imagined, there were very few
absent.
Mr. McDaniels offered to help them conduct the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_727'>727</span>meeting. After the boys had elected president, vicepresident,
secretary and treasurer, inasmuch as Mr.
Chadwick (the principal) was much interested in the
formation of athletic organizations, Mr. McDaniels
proposed that he be chosen as honorary member of the
association. The boys rose to the occasion and elected
Mr. Chadwick to this position.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now it has been my experience that questions come
up for decision which call for mature judgment. I
suggest that you elect an advisory board to be made
up of your officers, two members of the faculty and
Mr. Chadwick.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Knowing that Mr. McDaniels had their interests in
mind, the boys immediately responded to his suggestion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The result was that a coöperative body of pupils
and teachers was organized to the great advantage of
all interests concerned.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Altruism</p>

<p class='c012'>A man may be thoroughly acquainted with the highest moral
laws and yet have a very weak character.—Hughes.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the above statement is true, and we believe it to
be so, then the futility of trying to make people good
merely by teaching them principles of goodness, is immediately
apparent. Some more effective means of
training must be found and those means undoubtedly
should be experience and habit. Especially is this
true of little children. To them principles and laws
are mere words; experience is everything. With
<span class='pageno' id='Page_728'>728</span>adults the precept is more effective, not because they
are so different from children, but because they already
have had experiences by means of which they
are able to interpret and apply the principle, or proverb,
or law. Principles, proverbs, laws, are only deductions
from experiences.</p>

<p class='c007'>If real morality is the outgrowth of experience, it
follows of necessity, that the best and surest and indeed
the only way to teach anything more than the outward
form, is to give to pupils opportunities for performing
moral acts. There must be self-guidance, there must
be a yielding of one’s own desires to the rights of
others, there must be coöperation, teamwork.</p>

<p class='c007'>The kindergarten, better than any other branch of
our school system, has realized the necessity for this
type of social training. There the aim is to have children
learn, through give-and-take relations with associates,
what sort of conduct will best promote the happiness
of all. Instead of exhortations about the obligations
of children to parents, the little ones dramatize
those relations, thus gaining just those experiences
which enable them to comprehend the obligations.
So with the industries, the wild animals, the
busy bees, the birds, even the flowers and trees. One
by one, the life of each is “tried on,” so to speak, in
play, and inner relations of man to man and of man
to his environment are thus discovered.</p>

<p class='c007'>It goes without saying that these inner relations,
upon an understanding of which all true morality is
based, cannot be discovered all at once. Years of
“trying on” of racial experiences and relations are
necessary, and even then the comprehension of obligation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_729'>729</span>will be just as narrow as experience has been.
Meanwhile the inexperience of the child must be supplemented
by the larger knowledge of the adult. The
right outward form of action must be stimulated by
approval, expectation, suggestion, substitution of better
forms for the child’s crude, impulsive act, and coöperation
on the teacher’s part in such activities as
will lead toward higher forms of altruistic action than
the child is able yet to fully comprehend. The teacher
must never lose sight of the fact that moral insight
depends upon a process of growth; nor must he be discouraged
if the moral horizon of his pupils is extremely
limited. It is as wide as experience has been. The
remedy for narrowness is to supply the experience that
will furnish the wider outlook.</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) <i>Infancy and early childhood.</i> Many parents
and teachers make the sad mistake of beginning the
rational training of their children before the period
of rational thought has arrived. An amusing example
of common sense and the lack of it occurred one day
in a family which consisted of a mother, who had imbibed
some ill-digested, sentimental ideas of rational
training, her eight-year-old son, and her three-year-old
daughter.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 135</h4>

<p class='c016'>The child was playing with a cat upon the rug, and
finding great delight in its piteous meows when she
pulled its tail. The mother remonstrated at each outcry
in about this fashion:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Margy, <i>dear</i>, don’t pull poor kitty’s tail like that!
Don’t you know it hurts poor kitty? How would you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_730'>730</span>like to have mamma pull your hair? I wouldn’t do it
now. Try to make kitty happy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why don’t you pull her hair, and show her what
it’s like?” inquired Donald, who was reading in the
window-seat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I want her to learn to think such things out for
herself,” the mother replied with a wise air. “I want
her to put herself in kitty’s place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Huh—she’ll never do it unless you make her. Let
me show her, will you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, indeed, Donald. I’m afraid your method
wouldn’t be very gentle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I bet the cat doesn’t think she’s very gentle,
either,” and Donald went back to his story.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Margy must learn to do her own thinking, of
course. I remember when you were a baby, Donald—Margy,
child! Mercy, what a howl. Pussy! Margy,
can’t you see you hurt poor pussy? Hurt it, dear—just
hear it cry! Makes it feel all badly, as Margy
does when she’s ill. Just hear poor kitty cry!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Margy was “hearing poor kitty cry” with new delight
at each piteous meow, which she took to be dear
kitty’s means of entertaining her—having never been
taught to associate the sound with pain of any kind.
Just then the door bell rang, and the mother had to
leave.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Donald, dear, you look after Margy while I’m
gone,” she said, as she closed the door.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Before allowing a three-year-old child to handle a
cat at all, give explicit lessons on how to handle it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_731'>731</span>properly. Teach the child the meaning of the words
“Don’t hurt” by inhibiting the movement of her hands
<i>before</i> she has done the mischief. (See lesson on
“Don’t Touch” in “Easy Lessons for Teaching Obedience
in the Home,” Book I, p. 46—Beery.)</p>

<p class='c007'>Give an imitative lesson. Holding the cat yourself,
gently stroke its fur, showing Margy the proper way
of handling the cat. Then take Margy’s hand and
gently pass it over the fur in the same way.</p>

<p class='c007'>See to it that the child does not have the cat at all
except when some older person is there to control her
action, until such time as she has learned the meaning
of the command, “Don’t hurt,” and will obey it. In
other words, do not allow the wrong habit to become
established before the right way is comprehended.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Margy’s mother was assuming an understanding in
matters concerning which there had been no adequate
experience on Margy’s part. Protected continually
from pain herself, how could she understand the meaning
of the word! To her the cat was just another musical
instrument. Best of all, it was one upon which
she could play. Donald’s method, though not recommended
here for general acceptance, was at least
effective.</p>

<p class='c007'>Donald was an obedient child, and closed his book
promptly. He also, with some satisfaction in the duty
assigned him, sat himself down on the rug near his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_732'>732</span>baby sister, and his attitude of watchful waiting might
have struck an observer as purposeful and determined.</p>

<p class='c007'>Margy held pussy firmly by the loose fur at the
back of the neck. She stroked her until she was fairly
quiet again, then quickly gave the long tail another
hard pull.</p>

<p class='c007'>Quick as thought, Donald reached over and pulled
his sister’s hair vigorously. She howled lustily, and
the cat ran away. Donald let her cry for a little while,
then gave her back the recaptured cat and sat again
near her. Before long the pulling occurred again,
and again Donald pulled as lustily at Margy’s curls.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you see what it’s like? Do you like to have
your hair pulled? Are you going to quit it?” he inquired.
Margy adored Donald, and it did not occur
to her to resent his means of enforcing his lesson.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Want the cat back? You can have her if you won’t
pull her tail. Will you let her tail alone?” he asked
again. Margy said she would, and Donald again captured
the cat and put it into her arms. This time
Margy did not pull its tail. She stroked it, still holding
it tightly by the fur; but she had learned that
pulling a cat’s tail had sad consequences when Donald
was near. She never repeated the act when her brother
was within reach, although she did it when alone or
with her mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pulling hair is not a good form of punishment, but
Donald’s method was based on sound principles, of
which of course he was utterly unconscious. A baby
should not be asked to make judgments, but he should
be taught that pleasant consequences follow some acts
and painful ones follow others. This is nature’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_733'>733</span>method of teaching human beings, and no one can
improve on it as a method of last resort for the young
human animal.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Look what I’ve found,” Harry Jennings cried to
his friend, Captain Stanhope. The captain was sitting
on a park bench reading his morning paper, and
Harry had been running races with Gyp up and down
the gravel walk. He came up to the bench, now, with
a handful of souvenir post cards in his hands.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Applying “Golden Rule”</div>

<p class='c007'>“Some one has been addressing them here in the
park, and then went off and left them on the bench,”
he continued. “See, they’re addressed to people all
over the country, and not a stamp on one of them!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have seven cents in change,” said the captain,
pulling out his worn little purse. “That will send
seven of them, but there are a dozen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Harry brought out a dime from his trousers pocket,
and looked at it thoughtfully. It would just pay his
admission to the community ball game that afternoon,
and if he used half of it to send off a stranger’s postcards,
he must stay at home, for this was the last of his
week’s allowance. Still, there was the captain, the
knight of a dozen campaigns, looking at him. Harry
knew that he allowed himself but one cigar a week,
for his pension was subject to heavy drains; and yet
he contributed his seven cents without hesitation.
Surely, to share the doing of a good turn with the captain
would be worth staying home from the ball game.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here’s a dime, and I’ll send the rest,” he told the
captain. “Shall I take them to the postoffice?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_734'>734</span>The captain used the most subtly effective of all
appeals to a child to do right—he assumed a willingness
to be generous on Harry’s part, and offered him a

Harry have appeared stingy and selfish and little,
before the captain. And having set for himself a certain
standard of generosity, it will not be hard for
Harry to be generous when his next opportunity comes,

<p class='c007'>“Here, you little rascal, finish up in that corner!”
called out old John Smith, the janitor, to Oldham, who
was helping him sweep the basement. Old John had
rheumatism, and the school board allowed him to employ
a boy at twenty-five cents a night, to help him
with the sweeping. Oldham had secured the job, and
hoped to earn a new suit before spring.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am finishing up in this corner,” he answered,
indignantly. “I’m not done yet, but I’m getting it
clean.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“See that you do, then,” and old John turned painfully
to his own work. His eyes were growing dim,
and because he could not see he thought he might
insure thorough work by severity. Soon Oldham came
to him for more directions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go into the furnace-room and sweep up in there,”
old John told him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Oldham saw that the furnace-room was very dark,
indeed. “He’ll never know whether I’ve done the
corners in here or not,” he told himself. And still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_735'>735</span>smarting a little with resentment at old John’s undeserved
gruffness, he slighted his work and finished in
short order.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Pursue a plan exactly the opposite of John Smith’s.
First, approve the boy’s willingness to coöperate with
you. Expect the best work Oldham is capable of doing,
and show your appreciation of his assistance. Tell
him how glad you are to have the help of his young
eyes and willing hands.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>This and the following incident show the play of
social reaction upon conduct. For the approbation
of a friendly, trusting man, who showed that he believed
Oldham to be a boy of honor, Oldham cheerfully
did his task honestly and well; to old John, distrustful
and discourteous, Oldham responded with the
trickery he invited. Oldham should have been more
deeply grounded in principles of honesty, of course;
he should have been indifferent to a childish, ill, old
man’s acidity. But Oldham was very human in the
personality of his attitude; the world abounds in people
like him.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (EIGHTH GRADE)</h4>

<p class='c016'>As Oldham went through the outer room to put away
his broom and dustpan, Mr. Miller, the principal,
entered.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Better Method</div>

<p class='c007'>“Hello!” he called out, cheerily. “So you’re the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_736'>736</span>boy who’s helping out in a pinch, are you? I know
John Smith appreciates that, and so do I. This floor
looks as though you might have swept it—not a speck
to be seen. Did you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir.” Oldham’s checks flushed with pleasure.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good, sincere work. Every corner clean. Well,
I must go on up. I came down to see how John here
was getting on, but since you’re helping him I needn’t
stay longer. Aren’t you about through, yourself?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In a few minutes, Mr. Miller,” Oldham replied.
“I have to do the furnace-room yet.” And he turned
back to do a bad job over.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) <i>Adolescence.</i> In learning the great lesson of
altruistic living it is not strange if young persons sometimes
fail to see their acts in clear perspective. Only
time and more experience can furnish that perspective.
The following incident illustrates an exaggerated ideal
of altruistic service on the part of a high school boy
who sacrificed his scholarship for athletics.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 137 (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Overdoing Altruism</div>

<p class='c007'>Oscar Colegrove was the most popular boy in the
Vernon High School. His kindness and courtesy won
the girls, his unusual size and strength were admired
by the younger boys, and his manliness won the love
and respect of the older boys, but he was not studious
enough to gain the approval of his teachers. He was
an especial trial to Mr. Watkins, teacher of Caesar.
He had never understood English grammar—the Latin
forms meant nothing to him. When he recited, everybody
was glad when he got through.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Oscar was a famous basketball player. Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_737'>737</span>Watkins had decided to make him carry his Latin or
drop out of athletics. He had revolved in his mind
the best method of making this fact known, but had
come to no definite conclusion, when fate seemed to
take things in hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>One morning Oscar was unusually stupid in Caesar.
Mr. Watkins kept him on his feet asking him question
after question and growing more and more angry
with every wrong answer. He even asked him to translate
the beginning chapter about “All Gaul,” so well
known to every student of Latin. Oscar ludicrously
stumbled over the easiest parts. Mr. Watkins was
the angrier because he had thought to cause Oscar to
be ridiculed by his classmates, who only seemed to
suffer with the tortured boy. Finally, in disgust, Mr.
Watkins banged the textbook down on the table and
said, in angry tones, “Oscar Colegrove, you shall not
play another game of basketball until you can make
a decent recitation in Latin.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You don’t mean that I can’t play tonight. (That
night a game was to be played at Vernon with a famous
out-of-town team.)</p>

<p class='c007'>“O, I know you want to show off tonight! You’re
afraid somebody else will get the honors due to you,
if you drop out. You’re too selfish to want to give up
being a hero. This is your last game until this Latin
is learned.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That night Oscar played on the team and the next
day he was absent from school.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Mr. Watkins went to the recitation room to
meet his class in Caesar, he found not a student there.
On his desk was an envelope addressed to him; opening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_738'>738</span>it mechanically, he found this note within, signed by
all but three of the class.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Caesar class will be adjourned until the most
unselfish of its members, Oscar Colegrove, is allowed
to play basketball as well as to go on with his studies.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Watkins called a meeting of the school board
that night and admitted that he had not handled the
case of the delinquent pupil wisely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I contemplated dropping him from the team and
I wanted to show the class that I was justified by letting
them see how little he knew,” Mr. Watkins said
in self-defense.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the private conference the next day, Oscar promised
to study his Latin more faithfully and the entire
class reassembled. Oscar’s lessons were better learned
thereafter and Mr. Watkins seemed to have gained
his point, but he knew too well that he would not be
able that year to fulfill his earlier prophecies of being
an ideal leader of his students.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Watkins should have delayed passing sentence
until he had calmly decided upon the best method of
communicating his decision to Oscar. He should have
said to Oscar privately: “I know all of the pupils want
you to stay on the team and I do myself. I know also
that you and I are agreed that you must keep up your
studies. For a week I will assign you certain topics
for review and hear you recite them here in the office
or at my home, whichever suits you better. With this
extra effort and a reasonable amount of time put on
your daily lessons, you will be able to please everyone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_739'>739</span>including yourself, by both carrying your work and
playing for the school.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>A really selfish boy is never a general favorite. Athletic
boys are often heroes of the entire school and
are considered self-sacrificing by all whom they represent.
The question of athletics and grades should be
handled privately by the principal of the school.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION 1 (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Keeping Balance</div>

<p class='c007'>M. Zigler said in confidence to Carl Worley, one of
his athletic boys who was “falling down” in grades.
“It takes a self-sacrificing boy to work valiantly for the
good of his school. I know you will get good mental
and moral as well as physical training on the ball team,
because, of course, you play a clean game. But there
is a school ruling that forbids a boy who has fallen
below grade in his studies to keep a place on an athletic
team. This rule was made for the good of the
boys as you can easily see. I am sure we agree with
the people who made it. Now, we can’t make the days
longer for the team; I wish we could. The only thing
to do is to make the time we have count for the most
possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I propose that you and I make a daily program
for your use outside of school hours. Many college
men find this a great help in getting much done in a
day. In it we will provide ample time for school
studies. This will do away with trouble for you and
me as well as for the team, for if you follow it you
can make good grades and stay on the team, too.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_740'>740</span>Together Mr. Zigler and Carl made a program which
included practice with the team as well as study
periods and plenty of time for meals and sleep. A
careful following of this program showed that with
the time properly used, there was no need of cutting
short either study or recreation.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION 2 (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<p class='c016'>“And I like Philip Lampey,” said Jeannette. “I
don’t know him very well, but he always has such excellent
manners and he does get his lessons. Don’t
you think he’s awfully fine?”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Helping a Comrade</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Parsons and Jeannette White were discussing
the high school seniors in a very friendly and personal
way. When Philip Lampey was mentioned the
teacher’s brow clouded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m beginning to be worried about Philip, Jeannette,”
she said. “He’s being taken up by that fast
set, and he seems to like it. He’s losing his frank
way, and beginning to swagger just a little, and to be
oily instead of just courteous. I don’t think he’s very
far gone. Now, he likes you; can’t you help us out,
and save Philip from going over to that cigarette-smoking,
idle crowd?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know, but I’ll talk it over with mother,”
Jeannette promised. “I don’t think I have very much
influence, however.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A few days later Jeannette called to Philip as they
were passing to geometry, “Oh, Philip, mother is giving
me a birthday party on the 22nd and I want you to
go over the senior class with me and help me make out
the guest-list, and perhaps you have some ideas about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_741'>741</span>things to do too. Can we do it after physics this
afternoon?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We sure can,” Philip assented, much delighted
to find himself social arbiter. “I’ll be at your desk
at 4:05.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So Philip came to Jeannette’s desk, and they began
on the list.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s Sam Blennerman, he’s a good fellow.
You’ll want him,” he suggested, as they came to one
of his new chums.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That stuffy little snob? I should say not!” Jeannette
lifted her nose in great scorn. “The other day
I heard him making fun of Earl Stubbs because he
stayed out to go to church in Lent. I think he’s insufferable!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you? Oh, he’s not so bad when you know him,
though. Well, how about Vernon East?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He smells like a tobacco shop. I never saw him
without one of those nasty little rolls of his in evidence.
Father would want to know what I was
coming to.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sylvia Fanslow, Mark Gorham, Francis Hingham—I
suppose they all go on?” Philip held a tentative
pencil in air.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. And Emil Irwin. Leave out Leonard James,
of course.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But why? His family’s awfully good, and he’s
no end of fun. Keeps things in a roar, you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I know. I know his kind of a roar—he thinks
he’s such a man of the world. But isn’t he the boy
Mr. Burcher almost expelled for swearing on the
campus?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_742'>742</span>“Well, yes, he is. But you wouldn’t expect him to
swear at your party you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Naturally not. But I haven’t any use for a boy
who has one set of words for girls and another for
boys. That’s a double standard and mother says
double standards of any kind are bad.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Philip was suffering a revision of his ideals at the
hands of this girl. In the evenings he spent at her
house, planning the party, he came to revise them
further still as a result of the tactful suggestion of
Jeannette’s mother. When the party was over, he
found his taste for the “fast crowd” had disappeared.
To keep Jeannette’s good opinion he would have pretended
to believe anything, but so pliable is youth
before habit has fixed one’s attitudes, that he had
really come to believe in the same high standards that
Jeannette held.</p>

<p class='c011'>The aim of the teacher should be to obtain reverence for

  <h3 class='c001'>CASES ARISING OUT OF THE REGULATIVE INSTINCTS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>1. Differing Ideals Lead to Conflict in the
Regulation of Conduct</p>

<p class='c007'>By regulative instinct is meant the tendency on
the part of every normal human being to conform to
custom, reason, principles, law. It includes voluntary
obedience to authority imposed upon the individual
from without, but it is more than that; it is an inward
recognition that such obedience is fitting and obligatory.
It impels even further. It leads the individual
to <i>impose upon himself</i> laws and standards of action
even in the absence of outward authority. It is thus a
tacit recognition of moral law and of religious obligation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not much reflection on the teacher’s part will be
needed to convince him that if the outward authority
to which the child has been subjected at home has
been arbitrary, vacillating, tyrannical, or fitful, the
child’s ideals as to what is right and what is wrong
will have become sadly jumbled long before he enters
school, where the teacher has the difficult task of
straightening out the tangles. Or again, if the standards
of action, which the child more or less unconsciously
imposes upon himself, happen to conflict with
the teacher’s ideals of what right conduct on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_746'>746</span>pupil’s part should be, then, also, is there likelihood of
a clash between teacher and pupil.</p>

<p class='c007'>Too often when this occurs the teacher is satisfied
to secure outward conformity to regulation without,
at the same time, attempting to change the inward
ideal. In such a case there is the anomalous condition
of apparent obedience to a rule in which the child
does not believe. The body yields to coercion but the
mind rebels. Half the child obeys, the other half
inwardly disobeys.</p>

<p class='c007'>How disintegrating to the real moral life of a child
such a double-faced procedure must be, can best be
realized by the teacher if he imagines himself placed
in a similar position where he is compelled by principal
or school board to carry on a course of action which
is either highly repugnant to himself or which he believes
to be absolutely wrong. Only half-hearted responses
at best will result from such coercion in the
case of either pupil or teacher. The question, then,
of how to secure the obedience of the <i>whole child</i>, not
merely the physical half, becomes one of great seriousness.
Obviously it can never be accomplished by
methods which systematically arouse antagonism
toward the person who commands. The true method
of control must seek to substitute a better ideal for
the crude one held by the child. Coercion may sometimes
be necessary, but the teacher should not feel
that the act of obedience is completed until the mind
of the child has been swayed to <i>voluntary</i> submission.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the treatment of the regulative instincts which
follows, the chapter on Obedience, strictly speaking,
should be included; because of the great importance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_747'>747</span>of the subject of obedience it has been given a Division,
by itself (Part I). While, however, the more abstract
phases of the subject are dealt with in that chapter
the present treatment aims to be more concrete. Furthermore,
what immediately follows has reference
mainly to the lower grades, because there the child’s
school habits are formed, but the teacher who is on
the alert for principles that are fundamental will be
quick to perceive that whatever laws are basal in the
control and discipline of children in primary grades,
are equally so for older pupils because they are laws
that apply to all humanity.</p>

<p class='c007'>With these preliminary remarks, we pass, then, to
the consideration of methods of regulation of conduct
in the primary grades and especially in the first.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Importance of the First Year in Regulation
of Conduct</p>

<p class='c007'>It is safe to say that the most important school year
of the child’s life is the first year. The good taught
then may blossom into noble manhood and womanhood.
The wrong taught then may influence a young
life in such a way as to make it a burden to society
later on.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each of the higher grades has a share in molding
and shaping the child, but the foundation will be
laid in his first school year. It then becomes the
duty of upper grade teachers to build wisely upon
that foundation. The first grade teacher may have
done her work in the best possible way only to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_748'>748</span>the results torn down in a very few weeks in the
second grade.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nowhere in the child’s twelve school years is a more
proficient teacher needed. She need not be deeply
versed in the sciences generally, in mathematics, or
in history, but she must have other knowledge greater
than any of the sciences. The unfolding soul of
a child is God’s greatest mystery; the science that
deals with developing life is the science that the
primary teacher must know. The little minds of her
pupils are like strangers in a strange land. The
teacher is the guide. Her responsibility is of the
greatest.</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) <i>The first day.</i> Important as is the first year,
the first day of school is equally so. Not merely the
first day of the first year, but the first day of every
school year. That “first day” impression that the
teacher makes, often has a far-reaching influence.
Very frequently it is a day of confusion for both pupil
and teacher, neither knowing just exactly what is to
be done. There is no surer way to complexities than
to open school without detailed plans.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) <i>Detailed plans.</i> The simpler the plans the better,
but every detail of the daily program, lesson,
assignments, seating, etc., should be worked out carefully
beforehand.</p>

<p class='c007'>The teacher should meet the pupils with a friendly
greeting and without any hesitancy assign them to
their seats, adding such other instructions as are necessary.
However, not too many instructions should
be given; better none than too many.</p>

<p class='c007'>If parents accompany the pupils, they should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_749'>749</span>treated with consistent courtesy and their questions
answered firmly. It is always best to say as little as
possible to parents, never forgetting, however, to be
polite. As soon as school is begun, the teacher may
tell a story that will attract the children to her and
leave a good impression. Following the story, lesson
assignments should be made. All assignments and instructions
should be simple and plain. If it is necessary
to do some school work, the tasks should be short
and so simple as to be entirely within the ability of
the children. Take great care to leave with them at
the close of their first day the feeling of power to do
what will be required of them. In closing the session
mention some delightful bit of work, that “we will do
tomorrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In rural schools the first day is even more perplexing
than in village or city schools, because, in the
rural school, one teacher has all the grades. Plans for
study, recitations and recesses should all be made so
that any question asked about any phase of the school
work can readily be answered. As in the city school,
older pupils should be promptly assigned to their
seats; to allow them to select their own is poor policy
and almost always results in trouble later in the year.
If the teacher knows the names of the pupils, it is a
good plan to have the names on cards placed on the
seats in which the teacher wishes to have the pupils
seated. The smaller pupils should also be shown to
their seats and assistance given them in getting their
books into the desk in an orderly manner. After school
is called to order the work for the day should begin
at once. The teacher may give an opening talk if he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_750'>750</span>thinks that is best. However, it is advisable not to do
that. At this stage of the work it is very prudent for
the teacher to avoid making set rules or even feigning
authority. Be unassuming. As in the city school,
work on the first day should be simple. The pupils
have had no preparation and cannot respond in recitations.
Sometimes teachers ask the pupils to prepare
the lessons first, but they are in new surroundings and
not used to study; it is better to make assignments and
explanations, then fill the remainder of the day with
“busy work,” songs and stories. But whatever the
teacher does must be so done that the pupils will feel
that he is in earnest. Try to send the children home
that night with the impression that this term’s
work is going to be a very interesting and happy
one.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the first grade, children tire easily and consequently
lose interest. Therefore, they should have
frequent changes from one activity to another. The
lessons should be short, followed by “busy work,”
then a play period, or simply gymnastics. If gymnastics
are used the exercises should be varied. There is
such a wide range of possible exercises that it is easy
for any teacher to have plenty of gymnastic drills or
simple games, allowing much activity, which will interest
pupils for many months. None of the exercises
of the first grade should be carried so far as to tire the
pupils.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the foregoing, it is apparent that a well devised
daily schedule is important. It must be workable.
There must be no gaps in it wherein the teacher
gives the children idle moments. Material for use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_751'>751</span>during the day should always be arranged before
school opens in the morning.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Regulating the Movements of the Pupils</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the most necessary duties of the teacher at
the beginning of the year is to train the children to
habits of regulated and quiet movements when passing
in and out of the school-room, going to the blackboard,
coming forward to the recitation seats, passing
material for busy work, or during any other concerted
action. The first day is a particularly opportune time
for drill in quiet movement, not only because no lessons
have been made ready and, therefore, the teacher
is entirely free to take as much time as is desirable
without feeling that he is encroaching upon other
lessons, but also because such exercises impress upon
the children the necessity for quiet movement at a
time when their minds are not prepossessed with other
subjects. The suggestion is likely to lodge firmly in
mind at this time, partly because of the prominence
given to the thought and partly because of the absence
of conflicting interests on this first day. Furthermore,
in drilling the children from the start to recognize
the signals and to obey them, the teacher is taking
a long step toward securing control of his room. Of
course, he must not expect the children to learn the
whole lesson in one day. Even adults require “drill”
before they can respond perfectly to regulated movements.
To first grade children the signals and directions
are absolutely meaningless until the meaning
is taught. Nevertheless, even first grade children
<span class='pageno' id='Page_752'>752</span>can be taught easily to be quiet and orderly, and
if the drills are given as little games, competitive
or otherwise, they will look upon the whole thing as
play and hence will respond heartily.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suppose, for example, that the inexperienced teacher
who enters the school-room saying to herself, “What
in the world can I do to keep all these wriggling children
in order for a whole day!” should have some
of the following drills (abridged from Hillyer’s
“Child Training”<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c014'><sup>[3]</sup></a>) at command to use whenever
the children begin to be disorderly or seem not to
comprehend directions.</p>

<p class='c007'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. Hillyer, V. M.—Child Training, pp. 14–28.—New York. The
Century Co.</p>
</div>

<p class='c007'>(1) <i>Simple directions.</i> Say to the children, “I
want to see if you can do what I tell you, just when
I tell you, and just the way I tell you.” Then give
the order: “Stand up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Some may obey promptly, some may obey more
slowly, some may hesitate, look around to see what
the others are going to do, and finally, but tardily,
rise. Some may pay no attention to the order at all,
but look blankly around or at something else, exactly
as if they had been excepted from the command.</p>

<p class='c007'>If there is much irregularity in obeying correctly
and at once, it may be necessary to say, “All children
stand up,” or, “All of you stand up,” and this may
have to be supplemented by the explanation, “When
I say, ‘Stand up,’ I mean you, John and Mary, as well
as the others.” Then give the order: “Sit down.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Repeat these orders, “Stand up,” “Sit down,” half
a dozen or more times, until all the children understand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_753'>753</span>what is wanted and obey promptly, quietly,
and without hesitating or lagging.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have them first imitate you, while you execute the
order, as directed. This is training by imitation.
Then have them carry out the order from the command
alone. Give the order, but do not execute it
yourself, or better still, tell the children to close
their eyes and keep them closed while you give the
order and they obey. This is to prevent imitation
of others in the class. They are not trained until they
can obey promptly without seeing either the teacher or
another child whom they can imitate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Further directions may be: “Look up, down.”
“Face right side, left side.” “Place your hands on
top of your head, under your chair, behind your
back.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Afterwards, practice them individually, giving
more attention to those who are unfamiliar with the
terms used or are slow to carry them out.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) <i>Simple orders.</i> Give the first direction to a
child and wait his precise fulfilment, asking the class
if the child has followed the direction in every particular,
or if he has failed and in what respect he has
failed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each time an order is executed the children should
be called upon to suggest where an improvement is
needed, as, for example: “John banged the door.”
“He didn’t shut it quietly.” “He made too much
noise in going to the door.” “He asked which door,”
or “He hesitated,” “Took too long,” and so on.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) <i>Simple deferred orders.</i> Prepare a list of
orders as in the preceding drill and tell the children
<span class='pageno' id='Page_754'>754</span>you will give each one an order, but is it not to be executed
until you give the word. Then read the list of
orders, putting the name of a child before each order,
and when you have finished, say, “Now, do what I
have told you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>(4) <i>Negative orders.</i> The burden of much of
the instructions to teachers and parents is “Don’t
say don’t.” Nevertheless, for purposes of discipline,
practice in obeying negative commands
is highly important, as most laws and rules from
the Decalogue down, are prohibitions: “Thou shalt
not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Face the children away from you and tell them you
are going to practice them in obeying the order, “Don’t
look.” Tell them that when you have given the order,
they are not to look around, under any circumstances,
no matter even if a contradictory order is given, until
you call “Time.” Then give the order and behind
their backs try different devices to entice them into
looking. Tell a story and pretend to illustrate it, saying,
for instance, “Jack and Jill went up a hill, like
this” (stamp about or make noisy gestures), “to
fetch a pail of water, like this” (make chalk marks
on the blackboard, as if drawing) “and broke his
crown, like this” (drop a book or something heavy),
and so on. Suddenly speak into the ear of one, saying,
“Look here,” tap another on the shoulder excitedly,
and so on.</p>

<p class='c007'>(5) <i>Double orders.</i> Make a list as in drill 3, but
with two orders for each child, thus: “John, hand me
that book, and put this on the table.” Use in the same
way as in drill 2.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_755'>755</span>(6) <i>Prohibitions.</i> Tell the children you are going
to practice them still further in obeying “Don’ts.”
Then, give the order: “Don’t make any sound until
I call ‘Time.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>Allow them to move their heads, arms, feet; even
to move about, though this privilege should be forfeited
by any one failing in the slightest degree to
observe the command. Watch and listen for the faintest
sound and have them do the same, but only the
teacher must call attention to any voluntary or involuntary
breaking of silence. At the end of five minutes
call “Time.” Discuss with the children what they
could do to observe the command better or more easily
and repeat the exercise.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then tell them to get into a comfortable position,
one that they can maintain indefinitely, as they are to
remain not only silent but motionless. Ask them to
pretend that they are to have their pictures taken,
that the slightest motion, shifting of position or twitching—breathing
and blinking of the eyes excepted—will
spoil the picture, and say, “Now, don’t move till
I call ‘Time.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>Call “Time” at the end of two minutes, as this is
a very severe ordeal. Further practice, however,
should make them able to hold this position for five
minutes longer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tell the children you are going to command, “Don’t
talk,” and then are going to try to surprise them into
talking or asking a question, but they must say nothing
under any circumstances. Tell them they are supposed
to be mutes, without the power of speech—as
dumb as the animals.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_756'>756</span>Then give the command, “Don’t talk,” but continue
to talk yourself, telling either a story or something
about which children would ordinarily ask questions,
and if this does not succeed, abruptly ask one
of the children a question, trying to take him off his
guard or to startle him into a reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>Any wide-awake teacher will readily perceive how
these drills can be gradually extended to include the
concerted movements of the whole school, furnishing
both relief from more fatiguing school work and pleasure
in the performing, while, at the same time reducing
the chaotic movements of untrained children to
quiet, restful, intelligent, coöperative school-room procedure.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following case illustrates the difficulties of attempting
to secure the more complex forms of regulated
conduct without having first given sufficient drill
on obedience to directions.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 138 (FOURTH GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Dismissing Classes</div>

<p class='c007'>It was the custom in the Rockford school for the
children in the first four grades to put on their wraps
when the first bell rang for dismissal and then to return.
A second bell was rung as a signal for passing.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this time, Miss Walker, the fourth grade teacher,
had the habit of going out into the hall. Her pupils
then fairly flew out of the room and down the stairs
leading outside.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t crowd so, children. Why don’t you march
in an orderly fashion? There, Jimmie Blaine, you
almost knocked Hilda down. Now do be more careful
the next time.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_757'>757</span>But Jimmie was too far down the steps to hear these
last words.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Two bells should be rung for dismissal. Let the
first be a signal for the children to pass to the dressing-room
for their wraps. Let them pass in single file,
second row following the first, and so on. Let the
second bell be a signal for leaving the room. Here
again, the seating should determine the places in
line. Stand at the door leading out into the hall.
Then give the signal for passing. “First row, second,
third,” and so on. See that no child violates this
rule.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the children are once thoroughly familiar
with the order and with the meaning of the signals,
the first pupil in each row may be entrusted with the
leadership of that row and the signals may thus be
dispensed with.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fire drills should be held at least once a month.
Make the occurrence as unexpected as possible. The
regular method of formation of the lines should be
rigidly followed.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the gong rings, each teacher should immediately
drop the work at hand and say,</p>

<p class='c007'>“Attention! One, two, three!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The word “Attention!” signifies a definite attitude
of body and mind. The work at hand should be immediately
dropped, the head raised and the hands at rest,
while waiting for the next command. Do not give the
second command until you have the undivided attention
of every child in the room.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_758'>758</span>“One” signifies to turn in the seat; “two” to rise;
and “three” to pass.</p>

<p class='c007'>In case it is your week for corridor duty, take your
stand immediately at the head of the stairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lines of the four upper grades should be already
formed on the second floor and stairs leading to the
floor below, ready to follow the lines of the first floor,
or signal from the teacher on duty there.</p>

<p class='c007'>It should take no longer than five minutes to vacate
a building holding fourteen hundred pupils.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Walker could not expect order in the line
when she had taught no definite procedure. The only
thought in the minds of the children in her room was
to get out of the room as quickly as possible; the
manner of doing it was a matter of no consideration
to them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Children are naturally un-orderly; it is the teacher’s
duty to train them. In this case, she should draw
up an order of marching that the children could follow
habitually and without confusion.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (SEVENTH GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Dismissing School</div>

<p class='c007'>The bell rang for dismissal in the Bronx Park Grammar
School. Miss Forbes, the seventh grade teacher,
took her place at the door of her room leading out into
the hall.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rise!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pass! First row, second, third!” etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>One row after another filed out of the room in perfect
order. She stood where she could see the line
<span class='pageno' id='Page_759'>759</span>march down the stairs out-of-doors. At the same time
she watched the line formation in the room. Before
the last row had passed out of the room, she had taken
a second stand at the head of the stairs leading out
of the building. Looking back she saw the last child
in the last row close the door of her room.</p>

<p class='c007'>After her children, came those of the eighth grade,
while on the other side of the staircase the third
grade followed the second and the second followed the
first.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the four upper grades came down the stairs,
from the second floor, the boys on one side, the girls
on the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just two minutes had passed from the time the bell
rang for dismissal until the last child left the building.</p>

<p class='c007'>The foregoing method of line formation may be used
on every occasion. By keeping a rigid form of discipline
in moving lines up or downstairs, the children
may be depended upon to march quickly and in good
order in case of fire. This matter of perfect handling
of the orders of march cannot be too strongly emphasized.
Any lack of firmness in such regime will be sure
to bring disastrous results in a fire.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 139 (SIXTH GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Passing to Classroom</div>

<p class='c007'>It was just eleven o’clock—time for Miss Finch’s
sixth grade class to pass from her room to one further
down the hall where they were to have their music
lesson.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may pass, children.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Albert, I’ll help you with your problem now if
you will come up to my desk.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_760'>760</span>The children literally fell over one another to get
out of the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Finch was interrupted in her work with Albert
by a great confusion of laughing and talking in the
hall.</p>

<p class='c007'>She hurried to the door and saw the boys pushing
each other out of line, bumping into the girls, and,
in a word, doing everything but what they should
have done, namely, march quietly and in an orderly
way down the hall to the room in which they were to
have their music lesson.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Every time your class has occasion to pass from the
room, take the same stand by the door, leading into
the hall. Then say, “First row, please pass! Second,
third!” etc. When the last line has left the room,
take another permanent stand in the hall, where you
watch the children to see that they keep in a straight
line and march in an orderly fashion from room to
room.</p>

<p class='c007'>If one or two should “forget” to be quiet, speak to
them while in line. “John, remember the rule for
marching in absolute order.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Every teacher must remember that her presence
should mean order. If the children are accustomed to
see Miss Finch in the same place every time they pass
from the room, they will consciously or unconsciously
realize what she expects from them—perfect order.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Finch could not expect a room full of healthy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_761'>761</span>wide-awake children to pass from one room to another
without noise, when her own attitude conveyed anything
but a suggestion of quietness. She put the
others entirely out of her mind when she told Albert
she would help him with his problem.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not necessary to take the stand of a policeman,
but your attitude should be one of expectancy that
all will pass quietly and in order. It should not,
however, be necessary to speak of the matter before the
whole class, unless in commendation of the fine reputation
which “our school bears for its quiet good
order.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Passing to Classroom</div>

<p class='c007'>The bell rang in the East Aurora High School for
the beginning of the first period. Miss Wilcox took
her accustomed stand by the door of her section room.
Thirty-five young men and women filed out on their
way to the first class of the day.</p>

<p class='c007'>They passed the next classroom door, where Miss
Michael, the mathematics teacher, stood. Her attitude
was pleasant but firm. She was expecting order.</p>

<p class='c007'>After turning the corner of the building, they were
met by Miss Aldrich, the science teacher, into whose
room they marched, still in single file.</p>

<p class='c007'>To one boy, who had been especially troublesome in
line at the beginning of the year, she said, “Splendid,
Joseph, you are getting so that you can turn as square
a corner as a cadet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The next case is a good illustration of what a teacher
should <i>not</i> do in attempting to secure regulated conduct.
The story is its own sufficient comment.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_762'>762</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>CASE 140 (EIGHTH GRADE)</h4>
</div>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Keeping in Line</div>

<p class='c007'>“Here, come back here, you fellows,” called Mr.
Girdlestone, the teacher, to two lads going up the
steps ahead of the lines. “What’s the matter with
you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The boys came back down the stairs, but as Mr.
Girdlestone turned around the older boy again started
up the steps.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Didn’t I tell you to come back here till your line
formed, John?” cried the teacher, angrily, as he
grabbed the pupil by the collar.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I guess you won’t shake me,” responded the boy
angrily as he caught the teacher’s arm.</p>

<p class='c007'>A scene of confusion followed, but the youth got
his shaking and went sullenly about his work.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the close of the day the pupil was called to the
office.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I fear I must punish you more severely for your
conduct in resisting my correction, John,” began
the teacher, firmly. “Come down stairs with me and
we will try to settle this affair.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I guess you will have to ketch me first,” returned
John, with triumph in his voice, as he ran down the
other stairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Girdlestone was able to block his way of going
home, but unable to lay hands on the pupil.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may take your punishment or not get a chance
to go home tonight,” insisted the teacher.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you fire me, then,” suggested John quickly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t intend to suspend you,” replied the
teacher. “I don’t want to.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go ahead and fire me. I’m just lookin’ for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_763'>763</span>chance to quit school, anyway,” returned the boy,
sullenly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“John,” said the head of the school, firmly but
kindly, “come on with me and let’s talk this affair
over. Maybe we can settle it in that way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After considering for a few moments, during which
he eyed his teacher narrowly, John finally came along.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now,” said Mr. Girdlestone, as they reached the
office again, “I guess we were both just a little to
blame in this matter. I guess we both lost our heads
and were too hasty in our conduct. I am willing to
assume my share of the blame and apologize to you
for my hastiness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right,” replied the pupil, in a subdued tone,
“I know I didn’t do what I ought to in this scrape.
I got mad when you took hold of me, but I’m ready
to straighten the thing up now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well,” responded the teacher, kindly. “Let’s
shake hands on this affair and try to do better in the
future.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right,” said John, smiling, “I guess it will be
a lesson to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>John continued his school work with more interest
in the future and a few years later graduated from
the high school.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Some Things That Complicate Regulation
of the School</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) <i>Tardiness.</i> Tardiness in the first grade cannot
be intentional on the child’s part, nor should it give
the teacher any annoyance. It cannot be the pupil’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_764'>764</span>fault. Whenever a first grade pupil comes tardy the
teacher should ask in a kindly manner for the reason.
As a rule it will be some excusable cause, one which
the parents have imposed. The teacher should then
consult the parents. If they will start the children to
school soon enough, they will not often be tardy. Not
every case of tardiness can be prevented, however;
even teachers sometimes find themselves late on account
of some unavoidable incident.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) <i>Absences.</i> Sometimes first grade pupils choose
to be absent from school for a day and often for several
days. When the teacher goes to find out the
cause, she learns that the pupil is afraid of the teacher,
does not like to study, or there is some similar reason,
and he has begged to remain at home. The parents
have consented to the request. It is then the teacher’s
duty to assure the parents that she will do all she
can to win the child to the school. Her visit often
stops the truancy if the teacher shows that kindly
and courteous disposition that all teachers should possess.
Often when the parents tell a child that the
teacher is kind and good it has a tendency to overcome
his reluctance.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are very few first year pupils who will absent
themselves from school without their parents’ consent.</p>

<p class='c007'>With respect to older pupils, however, as long as
there are schools, so long there will be truancy. When
the teacher has made his school and school work interesting
and tried to be kind and courteous, he has done
very much toward abolishment of the truant. There
are many cases of truancy that teachers have succeeded
in stopping, but an investigation of the school revealed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_765'>765</span>the fact that the teacher was alive to his work;
every pupil knew that absentees would be missed;
further, that the teacher would ask for a reason for
absence. They knew that every detail of the school
was interesting and that they missed something when
away from it. In other words, it was far more fun
to be in school than out of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>If ever our readers feel that coercion is necessary
to get regular attendance, don’t punish, but try this
plan instead: talk to the class about some trip you want
to take with your pupils, perhaps to a woods. Play
upon their imagination as to what they would like to
do on that trip, what you will take along, etc., and
ask everybody to stand who is in favor of taking the
trip. Then say, “All right, be seated. There is another
thing to be said about this trip. Only those who
work well will be permitted to go with us. We are
going to have a great time and I hope everyone will
get the chance to go, but only those who have been
regular in attendance will receive an invitation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) <i>Careless work.</i> The first few weeks in the
first grade are trying times for the teacher. All habits
that she wishes the little ones to acquire, she must
carefully teach. Much patient explanation is necessary.
Often the work of the pupils will seem careless,
simply because the children do not know how to do
better. Then, too, what seems careless to the teacher
may seem very good to the child. The teacher must
not judge too hastily. If some children do get through
their tasks before the others do, because of careless
work, do not find fault but in subsequent lessons see
that the most interesting work is given to those children,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_766'>766</span>then act upon the principle of suggestion, by
saying how fine it would be to do the work in a certain
way. The child will at least make an attempt. Whatever
is done should be approved by the teacher. The
teacher who sympathizes with the pupils, helps them,
and directs their crude efforts, following each attempt
on their part with approval and a spirit of expectancy,
always encouraging, never discouraging, will soon have
no careless work among her pupils.</p>

<p class='c007'>(4) <i>Mischief.</i> Another point that the first year
teacher must learn is that all mischief committed in
primary grades is not premeditated. Healthy children
are full of energy. This energy seeks an outlet, and
in consequence, mischief may result. To leave childhood’s
energies undirected and undeveloped is a sure
source of trouble. In correcting mischief in primary
grades, harsh language should not be used. The kindest
explanation of the mischief and its results is the
correct way of dealing with childish misdeeds. The
child has never pondered over mischief and has not
thought ahead what the results may be. Therefore, it
is not malicious until wrong methods of control make
it so. By making prominent in his mind the right
activities you will just so far keep in the background
the wrong activities and his surplus vigor will thus
be stimulated in the proper direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>(5) <i>Dislike for study.</i> Fondness for study and
good habits in studying on the part of pupils will
greatly simplify the teacher’s control of the school.</p>

<p class='c007'>There often develops a tendency in pupils to dislike
certain branches. Especially is this true in the upper
grades. Such a dislike may often be traced back to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_767'>767</span>the primary grades, where the study habits and likes
or dislikes for school work are first instilled into the
child. It is vitally essential that the teacher foster in
her pupils that attitude toward school work that will
send the child to the second grade liking his work and
well trained in the habit of study. It would seem impossible
that a dislike for subjects that are not taught
in the primary grades could be traced back, even indirectly,
to wrong teaching in those grades. But the
chances are that somewhere in the child’s progress
towards the upper grades or the high school were sown
the seeds that developed into dislike of certain
branches. If so, the first grade teacher should take
her share of the blame. She must guard against any
methods of teaching that will cause any child to dislike
to study. It is quite certain that if first grade
pupils finish their year’s work liking the teacher
and the school and if they have acquired the habit
of study and like it, that teacher has done her full
duty.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a first requisite of the teacher to exhibit a
cheerful and optimistic disposition in the school-room.
She must teach the little ones reading and numbers,
language and story telling, writing and drawing, with
such an ardor and love for her work that the children
can only think that their teacher likes these subjects
better than anything else. She must expect every child
to love his work. If the second grade teacher and
the others in the higher grades will teach in the same
manner there will be no pupils in the upper grades
or the high school who have a distaste for even one
branch, much less have a dislike for study in general.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_768'>768</span>A true teacher will never make her pupils feel that
she has a dislike for school work or any part of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>(6) <i>Dull children.</i> Many a teacher has had her
difficulties and perplexities with the dull child. In
large cities special teachers are employed to teach dull
and abnormal children. Books have been written dealing
with them. Still the problem remains unsolved.
Much has been done for them, but by no means has all
been said about what can and should be done for such
children under these conditions. The rural and village
teacher cannot expect to send the perplexing
pupils to a special teacher and as a rule such children
are found in every school.</p>

<p class='c007'>One thing, however, she must make sure of—that is,
whether the dull child is such because he is subnormal,
or because of some physical defect, or because of poor
health. Poor food may cause a child to be dull. Bad
ventilation is often the cause of dullness in the school-room.
The teacher is responsible for keeping his room
well ventilated. If the dullness is due to ill-health,
the coöperation of the parents must be sought. If
the child is dull because he is subnormal, the teacher
must do the best he can, and that is very little indeed.
One thing he must not do—he must not worry. It is
not his fault. The situation will be made easier if the
teacher will secure the superintendent’s or a director’s
permission to let the dull child drop some of the school
work. The teacher should give the child the same attention
he gives the others; then his full duty has been
done. Never should a teacher intimate to any one
of the pupils or to the child himself, that he thinks
him dull.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_769'>769</span>Many times such a pupil can be very mischievous.
Whenever that is the case the teacher should apply
the devices and methods used upon other children for
particular annoyances. But just here is where the
greatest difficulty presents itself, for the fundamental
element in all methods is interest, and the dull child
can not be interested. Many times he can be interested
in manual work of some kind when he can not
be made to care for the more abstract work which
other children do with ease.</p>

<p class='c007'>No attempt will be made to discuss further the abnormal
child. The author feels that it is only protecting
the other children and the teacher both to have
abnormal children, as well as children dull because
of ill-health and mental defect, removed from the
school and placed in institutions established for such
pupils. Such a course may cause parents to become
indignant, but better that than to worry the teacher
overmuch and make him less efficient for the other
pupils, when he can not help the child in any way.
Nor has he been schooled to teach such children. They
should be handed over to specialists who are free to
adopt such methods as are best for the individual
child, but not necessarily so for the whole school.</p>

<p class='c007'>(7) <i>Retarded pupils.</i> In many states where there
are no compulsory school attendance laws, pupils often
come into the first grade at eight to ten years of age.
This also may happen where the child has been ill.
Sometimes thoughtless teachers make retarded pupils
feel odd and out of place, even unwelcome. The
teacher must remember that the school is a public
institution and every child has a full right to all of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_770'>770</span>its benefits. Not much more can be said to the teacher
than to add: treat the retarded and overgrown pupils
just like the others. If they do well in their work,
recognize their skill; if they are mischievous or cause
trouble, meet it as in the case of any other pupil. The
retarded or overgrown pupil must not be made to feel
either that he should be advanced, or on the other
hand that he has neglected his work, and for that
reason is out of place in the first grade when he should
be in the third or fourth. He must not be slighted or
treated differently from other pupils because he is
larger or older, unless it be to place some little responsibility
upon him like caring for the window plants or
assisting the teacher to pass materials for school work—duties
which may be regarded somewhat in the light
of special privileges.</p>

<p class='c007'>(8) <i>The “smart” pupil.</i> What constitutes the
“smart” pupil is hard to define, but every teacher
knows him when he appears. The pupil that is of this
type is not hard to control. To notice every little exhibition
of smartness tends to make it worse. As a
rule, the pupil is not so bad or so mean as to cause
any particular disturbance—he is only annoying. To
ignore him is the best cure and one that will in a very
short time cure the worst case in the first grade. When
such a pupil has said something that does not become
a good pupil, the teacher should begin to converse
about something entirely different and more interesting.</p>

<p class='c007'>(9) <i>Wrong influence of parents.</i> In this age of
poor parent control, there are more children in the
public schools whose misdemeanors are the direct result
<span class='pageno' id='Page_771'>771</span>of home influences than of all other factors combined.</p>

<p class='c007'>The prudent teacher of the first year needs often to
solicit the aid of parents in righting a spoiled child,
and often she must convince them that they are wrong
in their methods of rearing their children. If the
teacher cannot enlist the aid of parents, then she
must fight her battle single-handed. But there is no
need for discouragement. The child will love one who
loves him. A lovable and wise teacher often succeeds
where a parent fails. Parents are often alarmingly
short-sighted when it comes to training their children.
It is not an imaginary condition but one all too real,
that in many homes the children are, in actuality, the
controlling forces. It is distressing to see how helpless
parents can be, and what American parents are enduring
from their children. From such poorly regulated
homes come the “spoiled” children to the first
grade teacher, and in many instances all the meanness
such children can perpetrate is considered “cute” by
the over-indulgent parents.</p>

<p class='c007'>In dealing with the badly trained child, the teacher
must avoid any use of force. That would only antagonize
him. The teacher should be firm, but kind, treating
him just as he treats the others; if he does good
work, commending him for it. She need not even
notice many of his outbreaks—he will soon discontinue
them. Often he is spoiled because the parents have
paid too much attention to his every whim and fancy.
When he learns that he can not worry the teacher, and
that she will not contend with him in his trivial
desires, he will cease to annoy her. Last of all, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_772'>772</span>teacher can fill in the gaps of idleness in the child’s
time by keeping him interested and busy.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the child is saucy, the teacher must avoid telling
the pupil that he “must not be saucy”; such a method
will make the pupil aware of the fact that being saucy
is distasteful to the teacher, and he will resort to that
method whenever his spirits are ruffled. The better
thing to do is to ignore him altogether, and proceed
with the work at hand, as though nothing had occurred.
The teacher should not display the least emotion
by look or expression, for the child usually watches
the teacher to note the effect of his sarcasm or imprudent
statement. When he finds out that he is ignored,
he will resort less to his annoying habit. If the child
tries to tease her, she can casually and without any
use of force, draw him away into some interesting
game or activity. Or the teacher may call the pupil
by name and say, “Come here a moment, I have something
for you to do.” She may have a new game
ready and have this pupil be the leader. This will
draw his attention from teasing. In other words, substitute
some other and more interesting activity. A
few weeks of such control will remedy the annoyance.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a good plan with such a pupil to send him on
an errand every now and then, when he is in a good
mood, making the request in a confidential tone, and
saying to him on his return, “You are so kind for
doing that. Thank you ever so much.” This will
tend to get him in the habit of doing favors for you
and will increase his friendliness toward you. Another
way to establish more firmly his willingness to
be friendly is to make it a point to talk to him before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_773'>773</span>school or at recess about something in which you
know he will be very much interested—about his
favorite pastime or sport.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no boy or girl who does not have some
hobby, and after you have made an earnest attempt to
find out what that interest is and have begun to make
use of it in getting the pupil’s confidence, you will have
put into practice a great principle in discipline. Any
new idea which you can present regarding the hobby
will greatly help you to gain the confidence of the
pupil. By a confidential tone and by showing you are
in sympathy with his interests, you can gradually
win his confidence. Whatever you do, do not appear
to notice when a pupil is disrespectful to you. If he
has shown disrespect in the past, simply set about at
once to gain his confidence. If he ever mimics any
gesture you have made, do not take it seriously because,
nine times out of ten, you would get poor results.
Either appear not to notice it at all or, if you do
notice it, assume that it did not bother you in the least.</p>

<p class='c007'>To punish a child for anything whatsoever, suggests
to him precisely the thing which we do not want to
suggest. Whatever we want a child to be, we must
put the suggestion into his mind, that he already is
that very thing and approve him for whatever he does
in that direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principle of initiative in coöperation should be
used from the first in case of a pupil that is extremely
disobedient because of home or outside influence. Many
a teacher has invited such a pupil into his home for
a dinner or supper, and has entertained him with the
best the home afforded. In doing so he made the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_774'>774</span>pupil understand that he was interested in him. Often
a walk or a drive which gives occasion for a confidential
talk will establish friendly relations between pupil
and teacher. A teacher must not cease to try to win
the unfriendly pupil. One such in a school can work
great harm. The teacher must strive to make friends
of all his pupils.</p>

<p class='c007'>Approve the child’s lessons and efforts. Whether
it be numbers, or reading, busy work, or drawing, the
teacher must notice the effort and progress, and by a
pleased countenance and well chosen words encourage
the pupil. Whenever the teacher has a favor to bestow,
she should see that the unfriendly pupil gets his share
of the favor. If she is having a little play or song
or game, she may appoint him as the main character.
She should frequently walk with him part or all of
the way home. Such treatment will win the child in
a very short time, and what is better, it will usually
win the parents.</p>

<p class='c007'>In case a disaffected child is unusually stubborn
and absolutely refuses to obey you, avoid the use of
any commands to him until after you have entirely
gained his confidence. You may continue to command
and request other pupils around the stubborn child,
but simply refrain from asking that one to do anything.
Make up your mind that you are going to
cater to this stubborn pupil for two or three days in
order to win his absolute confidence and thus lay a
foundation for more satisfactory conduct in the future.</p>

<p class='c007'>By cater, we do not mean to allow the pupil to get
ahead of you—not at all. But it may be necessary to
be a little forbearing. Present absolutely nothing to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_775'>775</span>him in a personal way except what you know will be
intensely interesting. As we said before, find out what
the pupil likes to do at home, on the playground, what
he likes best to talk about, and then make it a point to
converse about those things frequently when alone with
him. Show great enthusiasm in talking along the
line of his interests. If he refuses to recite, get his
confidence and then ask questions, beginning with
such as you are sure he can answer in just a word or
two.</p>

<p class='c007'>(10) <i>Neighborhood conditions.</i> Sometimes a teacher’s
work is greatly hampered because of an unkindly
spirit existing between the parents of her pupils.
Mothers often “get even” with their neighbors by influencing
their children against a neighbor’s son or
daughter who happens to be in school. Or a teacher
may have used some unwise methods on a child, or
punished in a manner not satisfactory to the parents.
The parents retaliate by influencing their children
against the teacher.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both situations will respond to the same treatment.
By no means must the teacher appear to resent this
opposition. It is every teacher’s duty to treat such
pupils just as kindly as circumstances permit. If
the teacher is determined to win such parents he will
succeed, and in time they will become the best of
friends. In all cases where such a difficulty continues
to exist and is annoying, it is the teacher’s fault. To
gain the mother’s love, is to gain the child’s love
also.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sometimes gossip or misunderstanding causes parents
to oppose the teacher very bitterly. In such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_776'>776</span>case it is expedient that the teacher go to see the
parents and have matters understood, assuring them
she will use every means to do what is right and that
the parents’ assistance will be of great value.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. Submission to the Ringleader</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) <i>Lower grades.</i> Even in the kindergarten certain
children in every class stand out as leaders. In
classes above the kindergarten this characteristic of
leadership appears more and more strongly. If the
leader throws his influence alongside that of the
teacher, well and good. The teacher has thus a strong
ally. If the leader arrays himself against the teacher,
then the teacher’s own influence is weakened and in
many cases seriously crippled. In the lower grades
such an antagonistic attitude on the part of a single
pupil may not be a very serious matter, but in the
higher grades, and especially in high school, where
the clan spirit dominates, a single pupil may turn an
otherwise successful term into a failure. It is highly
important then for the teacher to understand how
best to overcome an unwholesome leadership on the
part of the pupil.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is but one basis upon which the teacher can
operate such principles of control as will secure the
hearty coöperation of the pupils. That basis is the
possession of their confidence. The teacher <i>must</i> have
the confidence of her pupils. It <i>must</i> be a confidence
that is deep and sympathetic. It cannot be superficial.
The pupil is a keen judge and will detect a superficial
attitude of the teacher. But the teacher who feels in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_777'>777</span>her heart a love for every boy and girl, a love that desires
to do the best for them, to build and strengthen
their characters, can not be superficial. It has been said
elsewhere, that whatever increases the confidence of
pupils in the teacher lessens the necessity of outer control,
and whatever lessens the confidence increases
the necessity of outer control. This is an important
fact and the teacher cannot too thoroughly study it.
It is the teacher who loses patience with the boy, when
he shows the first signs of waywardness, who fails to
attain the ideal in school-room control, who consequently
loses the boy’s confidence, thereby increasing
the difficulty of control. Such a boy, if he is a natural
leader, will form a clique of his own and place himself
at its head. He and his clan will see to it that
mischief does not languish in that school. The teacher
wonders why the boy regards her good admonitions so
lightly. He would regard and heed them, if she had
not lost his confidence. What, then, shall the teacher
do to regain and keep the faith and loyalty of every
pupil?</p>

<p class='c007'>No better plan can be given for the primary grades
than to tell the actual experience of one teacher of
forty-five boys and girls. Among these were bad boys,
who quarreled, fought, used bad language and did
other things that could not be tolerated in a wellordered
school. One was an only child; she controlled
her parents and insisted on similar privileges in the
school-room. By no means were the pupils well behaved.
The teacher studied her problem. In the first
week of school, she bore many annoyances, but she
found out who were leaders and just how annoying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_778'>778</span>the pupils could be, and also what they were capable of
doing. She knew the actual condition of the room
and had laid her plans to win. On the second morning
she entered her room bright and cheery. Before the
bell rang she copied a pleasing and easy little song
on the blackboard. As soon as the bell rang and her
pupils were in their seats she told them a very interesting
story, standing as she did so. Her manner was
pleasing and she held the attention of her pupils
throughout the story. When it was finished she turned
to the song and said, “Children, let us read over this
song together.” At once she started to read. Many of
the children did not read, but that did not deter her,
she read on. When through, she asked them to read
it again with her. This time more read. At the conclusion,
she faced the school and said, “How fine that
was! Do read it again for me!” This time every
pupil read because she had approved their reading
and showed pleasure and interest in what they did.
Then she asked them to help her sing. None sang
with her, but that did not daunt her. A second time
she sang. A few of the pupils sang with her, and
when through, she exclaimed, “I really did not know
you could sing so well! Why, we must sing often!”
She had won every boy and girl. In fact, they did
not know themselves that they could sing so well.
Again they sang. This time every voice helped. True
there were a dozen discords. But what did this teacher
care for discords. They were not evils. It was confidence
she was planting and nurturing. From the
song she turned to the work of the day, but casually
she dropped this remark: “I know this will be a pleasant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_779'>779</span>day. You all look just as though you would do
your best.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Through the day the teacher kept up that spirit of
cheerfulness. She approved and complimented the
crude efforts of each one. There was noise. There
were annoyances, but she overlooked them as best she
could. She was working for a larger end. Later,
when she found her plans did not win all of her pupils,
she took up each case of the few remaining wayward
ones and disposed of it by individual treatment.</p>

<p class='c007'>This teacher planned an autumn outing for her
pupils. One bright afternoon, when the sun silvered
the country side, and softened the red, yellow and
golden tints in the forest, she took her flock to the
woods. There were nuts to gather, wild grapes to
pick, asters and goldenrod to gather and garlands of
autumn tinted leaves to weave. Toward evening, she
assembled the children about her in a pretty spot in
the woods, and all ate together.</p>

<p class='c007'>Often she allowed the children to have little play
parties at which she was the leader. She knew no end
of “full-of-fun” games; her pupils never failed to
have a good time. She took them out skating. They
had snowballing bouts. Even when she wanted her
room cleaned and redecorated, she invited her pupils
to join her in the task and as they worked away, she
wisely directed their efforts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The teacher who is tactful can think of a hundred
and one things to do to please and win her pupils.</p>

<p class='c007'>All such affairs must be given to the pupils as expressions
of the teacher’s good will. There must be
that attitude toward the pupils that indicates to them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_780'>780</span>the teacher’s love for them and her interest and consideration
for them. Among such fortunate pupils
there will be no hostile ringleaders. All will readily
accede to the teacher’s wishes, because she lives with
them and for them. Such a teacher keeps her pupils
busy with those things that they enjoy doing; they
have no time to think of other things, than what the
teacher plans for them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The teacher who follows this course will be the
“ringleader.” She, too, will be the one whom the
pupils unconsciously will imitate and follow.</p>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Creating a Ringleader</div>

<p class='c007'>Georgie Bently had just been presented with a beautiful
green top as a birthday present. The length of
time it would spin when he wound it and gave it just
the right fling was something quite wonderful. It
was the dearest of all Georgie’s possessions. He took
it to school and every few minutes would take it out
of his pocket, feel of it caressingly and look at it admiringly.
At last he ventured to wind it with the
long string in his pocket, so it would “be ready”
when the recess period came.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this point in the proceedings, Miss Harriman,
his teacher, caught sight of what was going on.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Georgie Bently!” she called out, in a voice so
startling that Georgie involuntarily jumped.
“Haven’t I told you boys that you mustn’t play with
toys and marbles in school time? Bring it right here
to me, now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There!” she added, as she gave it a careless toss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_781'>781</span>into the drawer of her desk. “You can’t have it again
until Friday night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Humiliated Georgie crept back to his seat and buried
his face in his arms folded on the desk before him, in
order to hide a briny tear or two. Then he amused
the children near him by making faces at his teacher;
but this was rather monotonous fun. He finally decided
that the appropriate thing to do under the circumstances
was to draw pictures of Miss Harriman,
and relieve his feeling by jabbing his pencil through
the eyes, mouth, etc., of the drawing. The other children
saw the point and expressed their sympathy by
doing likewise with similar drawings of their own
production, giggling all the while as they did so, and
occasionally breaking out in mirth which again called
forth Miss Harriman’s expressions of disapproval.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My children have acted like little demons today!”
said the tired teacher that night, as she flung herself
into the rocking chair upon reaching home. “Sometimes
I wish I never had to go back again into that
school-room!”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Go quietly to Georgie’s desk and say, “What a
pretty top! Does it spin well? I’d like to see you
spin it after school is done, but you know we all have
to put our playthings away in school time. Can you
take good care of it until the bell rings, or would you
rather I would keep it for you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>If Georgie is like most boys he will put it safely
away when given a choice in conduct, and in so doing
will have had an excellent lesson in self-control.</p>

  <h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Miss Harriman repelled George by her apparent
lack of appreciation of something that to him was
precious. Her control of the situation was purely external,
coercive. She did nothing to rouse the boy’s
power of <i>self</i>-control. By using the principles of approval
and initiative in coöperation she would have
accomplished her purpose just as effectively, and at
the same time would have strengthened the boy’s self-respect
and self-reliance.</p>

<p class='c007'>By reproving George in a way that roused his antagonism
she turned him into a ringleader, for the
time being, the effect of which was to increase the
disorder, rather than cure it.</p>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Teacher Becomes Ringleader</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Moss went from a small town to a two-room
school in a mining settlement, to teach the first four
grades. The school consisted of forty-two miners’
children, and one very pretty, well-dressed girl of
ten, Florence Adamson, who was the daughter of the
company store-keeper. This little girl’s mother was
a clever dressmaker, who kept her daughter in the
smartest of frocks and the perkiest of big hair-ribbon
bows. The child was bright, learned her lessons easily
and had always been a leader of the other children,
who regarded her as a very wonderful being indeed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although Florence made trouble among the miners’
children occasionally, she was always forgiven this
when she “made up,” a process accomplished by the
aid of a winning manner and generous bribes of allday
<span class='pageno' id='Page_783'>783</span>suckers and gum. The children followed her
wishes slavishly, adored every silly thing she did, and
regarded her childish naughtiness in school as the
acme of brilliance. They tried to stand in her good
graces by outdoing her in whatever she did; if she
whispered, they talked in undertones, and if she threw
paper wads, they threw bits of coal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Moss had analyzed the situation by the end of
the first week. She saw that Florence had exercised
more influence than the teacher, through her ability
to provide amusement for the pleasure-starved little
people. Her entertainment usually took the form of
covert ridicule directed toward the teacher, and she
always organized and managed the playground games,
in so far as there were any. Miss Moss saw that she
must substitute her own wholesome leadership for the
leadership of this spoiled child. She saw that she
must introduce a wholesome democracy for the boss
management of a skillful and unscrupulous little
tyrant.</p>

<p class='c007'>She brought back with her from her first week-end
at home, several pretty waists and frocks which she
had not intended to wear to school; for she saw that
one element in her leadership must be the satisfaction
of the starved sense of beauty which lived in these
miners’ children. She brought back also some dotted
Swiss sash-curtains for the windows; but these she
did not put up at once. She announced on Monday
morning that she had a surprise, and that she intended
to let three pupils know about it that afternoon after
school. She was so very mysterious about her secret
that the children spent the day in speculation about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_784'>784</span>it. Florence found her efforts at entertainment, for
once, quite ignored.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course Florence expected to be one of the three
who were to share the secret after school, but at four
o’clock Miss Moss chose Edward Hare, a great, overgrown
boy who should have been in the seventh grade,
and Mollie Sluss, a thin, shy, little thing who always
bent over a book that she could never master, and Dicey
Savage, who was Florence’s most enthusiastic follower.
Miss Moss did not intend that the charge
should miss fire. Florence headed a crowd which
gathered at the windows to peep in at the uncovering
of the great secret, but Miss Moss merely directed the
favored ones to put on their things and go to her
boarding-house.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here each one was given a package to carry, and
the quartet returned to the schoolhouse. The first
package proved to be sash-curtains; the second contained
the brass fixtures; but the third was put upon
the desk, with the promise that is should be opened
when the curtains were up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Clean hands first!” said Miss Moss, and there
ensued a scrubbing bee. Then the curtains were put
up, with much awkward help from the children, who
were unused to such tasks. When all hung in snowy
beauty, then Miss Moss gathered her helpers about
her, and told them fairy stories while they ate the
candy that was in the box. It was really a little party,
and a party is a rare thing in the life of a miner’s
child.</p>

<p class='c007'>That was Miss Moss’ beginning; three children in
that school now regarded her as a source of happiness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_785'>785</span>and entertainment, and pretty things. Florence had
a rival; and in the days to come the children slowly
grew to feel that Miss Moss could make them have
better times than Florence could, and that pleasing
Miss Moss paid better than pleasing Florence. Miss
Moss had no scruples of conscience in pursuing this
course, for she knew that human beings have to be
won to right courses of action long before they can
be made to understand abstract reasons for doing
right. She knew she could not win those children by
preaching to them; she knew they would listen to a
sermon only after they had grown to love and trust her.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were many steps to the process of readjusting
the warped relations in that school. Florence
gradually, and not at all gracefully, accepted her new
position of plain lay member of the school, a person
with no special privileges, and with no abnormal influence.
The climax came at Christmas, when Miss Moss
trained her little band to present a short cantata in
which an angel told the news of the birth of the Babe
to representatives of all the nations of the earth. The
leading character was the angel, and here Miss Moss
encountered a common difficulty; Florence was really
the only child in school who could take the character
well. The others were all too shy or too phlegmatic.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Moss had to choose between a pretty, successful
performance, one which would bring her praise
and admiration, one which the company store-keeper
would report in glowing terms to the company itself,
and the final success of her scheme of normal adjustment.
She made the shy little Mollie Sluss the angel.
Mollie stepped on the end of the sheet in which she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_786'>786</span>was draped, she forgot her part twice and could never
be heard at the back of the room; she lost one of her
wings at an inopportune moment, and she failed most
lamentably to look like an angel. She looked more
like a lost soul which is too frightened even to ask the
way back to its habitat. Mollie was not a shining
success as an angel, but as a means to an end she did
very well.</p>

<p class='c007'>For Mollie’s father and mother sat in the audience,
and their usually heavy faces wore a look of pride as
their pale little daughter blundered through her leading
part. Mollie had her first taste of leadership that
day; Mollie knew that Florence no longer fell heir to
all the good things just because she was Florence.
Florence, meekly sitting in the background among
the heathen nations, accepted this new order of things
at last as inevitable, and submitted to taking her fair
turn with the others. Her bribes had ceased to produce
results; she had been outbid by one who could
offer her very place as leader, as a prize for merit.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Moss showed her mastery of the situation by
raising other children to prominence among the pupils
and thereby calling attention and admiration away
from Florence who had heretofore monopolized the
applause of the children.</p>

<p class='c007'>In doing this she gave no commands. She merely
brought about naturally a transference of admiration
from Florence to others.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the day when Miss Moss selected three pupils to
help her prepare her “surprise,” she acted wisely in
naming those whom she wanted. Had she asked, “Who
would like to help me?” many pupils would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_787'>787</span>offered their services and the selection of three would
have caused much antagonism, since the others who
offered their services would be sure she knew they
wanted to help.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) <i>Higher grades.</i> In the higher grades a ringleader
who arrays himself against the teacher’s authority
is much more exasperating than is a similar
pupil in the lower grades, not only because of his
greater influence upon other pupils, but also because
it is much more difficult for the teacher to make excuses
for him. “They know better!” is the thought
that will intrude itself into the teacher’s consciousness
to make difficult any feeling of leniency toward offending
pupils. What, then, shall be done? Must the
teacher watch the pupil closely and whenever he discovers
evil beginnings, punish the offender? No; that
is the method which in the past has driven thousands
out of the school, only to become permanent burdens
to society and in many instances paupers and criminals.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be necessary for the teacher to get the confidence
of such a pupil. Enlist his abilities in leadership.
He will thus become a valuable assistant to the
teacher in “regulating” his clique of pupils. The
teacher should interest the ringleader in his work, and
approve of his efforts and work whenever possible.
When there is some particular task to be performed,
have the ringleader do it. When a game is to be organized,
make him captain or leader, and so on. There
are scores of places where he can be pressed into service
in such a way as to gain his good will and confidence,
and at the same time in such a way as to make
him an aid to his schoolmates rather than a detriment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_788'>788</span>When once his confidence is won he will obey every
command and wish.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stating it briefly—if the ringleader feels you are
on his side and are sympathetic with him, then, just
as surely as water runs down hill he will come over
to your side.</p>

<p class='c007'>If you treat a boy as though he were on the same
level with yourself, you are taking the first and most
important step in winning his confidence. And he
will immediately see that you get fair play, especially
if he is a ringleader.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our experience with human nature tells us that a
sure way to get the confidence of another person is to
coöperate with that person along the line of his own
interests.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the above statements hold true of the grades, still
more do they apply to the high school.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) <i>High School.</i> Disciplinary problems in the
high school should be solved on the largest basis possible.
The increased scope of vision enables a pupil
to view a situation in the larger connections. In the
grades each act tends to stand by itself. The child
is taking one step at a time into a larger area. The
youth begins to make leaps over larger stretches and
is impatient with the pettiness of a narrow method.</p>

<p class='c007'>Consequently a wise teacher will omit all annoying
puerilities in managing high school pupils. He will
expect numerous childish follies to be retained even in
the high school period. In some cases a method used
with a child in the grades will work effectively in the
case of a high school pupil. But discrimination must
be very painstaking. A childish method, unwisely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_789'>789</span>used, dampens a pupil’s esteem for his teacher because
personal pride in the pupil has been injured.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, by using a solution that puts
the issue on a broad, high level, one appeals to the
maturing intelligence and sense of personal dignity.
Moreover, such procedure discloses to a pupil the connections
that bind a particular act to other factors.</p>

<p class='c007'>The boys who tied a schoolmate to the railroad track
first saw their deed in its isolation; under judicious
leadership the place of such a deed in the life of a
school community may be vividly conceived, and when
so viewed may be heartily repudiated. Such a type of
revulsion against an unsocial act is most healthful;
a mere decision not to repeat a proscribed prank has
little moral worth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole machinery of a well planned school system
is concerned in getting a response from pupils. Any
study which proves its worthlessness by winning no
general response when well handled, is to be abandoned.</p>

<p class='c007'>So much for the essential feature of school duty,
that is, winning an acceptance and reaction for the
lessons taught. But all the more this holds good in
respect to the personal relation between teacher and
pupil. If a teacher makes no effort to secure a personal
response toward himself he can not hope to educate
his pupils; he may feed an awakened intellect;
this alone can not suffice—coöperation must appear
in the teacher’s plans for the pupil’s good.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Failure to Utilise Leadership</div>

<p class='c007'>When Carl Lindstrom went to Bentley township to
teach for a year and so earn money with which to
pursue his law course, he had no fear of meeting resistance,
for this community was one of culture and
good tradition, in which the children expected to do
well in school and later to go to college. Carl himself
was always popular at college, and he had no idea
of being anything else in any community that he
might grace with his presence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before the first week was up, he had lost this happy
confidence. Charles Moxler was the cause of the new
distrust of himself which Carl felt; and Charles was
regarded as a model of boyhood in the whole countryside.
He was fifteen years old, large and handsome,
with charming manners and marked ability. He
learned his lessons seemingly without much effort, and
was a good violinist and a daring horseman. His attitude
toward Carl irritated the teacher from the first,
for he was not used to the easy, condescending tolerance
with which Charles regarded him. Charles never
refused to comply with any direct request; he obeyed
the letter of the law without quibble. Nevertheless,
Carl disliked him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Charles seemed to have more influence with the
students than the teacher had, and this influence
seemed to the sensitive teacher to be exerted in a way
to belittle his own authority. He resolved that when
a chance came he would show everyone who was master
in that school. The easy air of superiority of Charles
nettled him so that one day he made an issue, resolved
to reduce the insolent boy to his proper place. Charles,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_791'>791</span>who had a loud and resonant voice, was telling a group
of pupils of a football game he had seen the Saturday
before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Charles,” said Carl Lindstrom, “do try to talk
more quietly. You can be heard clear to the corner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right, sir!” sang out Charles, with easy good-nature.
The other pupils, especially the girls, with
whom he was a great hero, giggled, and Charles continued
his story in a low monotone. But it was an
exciting story, and soon he was talking as loudly as
before, while the rest joined in his hearty laughter at
the incident he was relating. Carl, sitting outside
the circle of fun and fellowship, felt his authority
seriously threatened, as indeed it was.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Charles Moxler, take your seat!” he called out,
suddenly, surprised himself at the irritation in his
voice. “If once asking isn’t enough, I shall have to
take other means. There is no sense in your talking
so loud, and when I ask you to do a thing, I mean it!
The rest of you may either take your seats or go
out-of-doors.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The pupils scattered, rather sullenly. School began
a few moments later, and Charles studied with unusual
application. When the algebra class was called,
he came forward with the rest to recite. When his
turn came to demonstrate at the board, he stepped
forward, placed his problem on the board, and then
began to explain in a voice so low that no one could
hear without straining.</p>

<p class='c007'>Carl had a mind to correct him, but, remembering
his pupil’s popularity and having some caution in his
make up, he refrained. Charles continued during that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_792'>792</span>day, and throughout the week, to address his teacher in
softly modified tones, so patently artificial that they
aroused the amusement of all the young people who
heard them. His manner was punctiliously respectful;
Carl could find no point of attack. He felt helpless
and imposed upon, and he was very conscious of
the amused smiles of his pupils and of their scarcely
concealed pity and contempt for him. Had he been
able to laugh it off as a good joke, all would have been
well, but Carl’s sense of humor did not extend to his
own affairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>This condition of things lasted for some time. At
last, Charles, either repenting his revenge or tiring
of the effort involved, resumed his natural voice and
manner, and acted in a more manly way toward his
teacher. But Carl’s year had been badly spoiled. He
knew he had made a mistake, but knew not just where
to look for it. How could one deal with a pupil who
seemed to have more leadership than one’s self? How
could he have avoided that humiliation and helplessness?
What had he failed to do? Whose fault was it?</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<p class='c016'>The next year he returned to college and Parker
Ames, a classmate, fell heir to the school in Bentley
Township. When Parker came back to college for
commencement, Carl, in cap and gown, hurried to him
to ask him about his year.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Coöperation with Leader</div>

<p class='c007'>“Greatest place ever, isn’t it?” said Parker Ames.
“I surely did enjoy those people, and I hope the
youngsters know a little more for my being there.
Great School!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_793'>793</span>“Did you have Charles Moxler?” asked Carl, thinking
to hear a tale of woe similar to his own.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should say I did!” Parker’s enthusiasm expanded
visibly. “He was the best one there, wasn’t
he? He was my right-hand man in everything I did.
I wanted to get up a festival to raise money for the
Belgian sufferers, and Charles simply wore himself out
working the thing up. We became mighty good
friends, I tell you; he was as good as a grown up any
day. He had such a hold on everybody’s heart, you
know, that all one had to do was to get him interested
in a thing, and the whole country simply followed
right along.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He had an awfully loud voice,” said Carl.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Big as his heart and smooth as his manners!”
assented Parker.</p>

<p class='c007'>Carl is still thinking about it.</p>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Ringleaders at Their Worst</div>

<p class='c007'>Instances of the operation of mob psychology in
schools are comparatively rare, but they occasionally
occur in industrial communities, where the walk-out
method of gaining ends is kept prominently before
pupils. Such an occurrence took place in the oil district
of a Middle West state, where the social conditions
are poor and the schools are not yet well organized.
Mr. Frank, a new principal, found that his
predecessor had gained and kept a certain degree of
popularity by making concessions to his pupils and
patrons which had greatly lowered the scholastic and
other standards of the school.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_794'>794</span>Mr. Frank resolved to sacrifice personal popularity
if necessary to the efficiency of his school, and among
the reforms adopted was that of doing away with a
Friday afternoon holiday which had been allowed to
all pupils who had had perfect attendance and punctuality
all week. This weekly half-holiday, which
reduced the working hours of the school one-tenth,
Mr. Frank considered a bad thing. He said nothing
about his plans to his pupils, but his rather rigid views
on other matters led them to suspect that he might
return to the old plan of five full days’ work; hence,
they came to him frequently during the first week to
ask if the Friday half-holiday would be continued.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wait and see,” he would reply; “I’ve not decided
yet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’d better,” replied one group of high school
boys. “We’ve had it for three years, and if you want
us to work for you and like you, just keep it up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This attitude of the boys settled the matter for Mr.
Frank, who called the board together and announced
his position. They agreed that the giving of the holiday
so frequently was a bad thing, and told him that
they would “stand back of him if he could make it
go,” which meant that they themselves were waiting
to see what he would do with a bad situation. The
board members were tradesmen who were afraid of
offending the families of the school pupils by initiating
such a reform themselves, but were willing to stand
by someone else who would do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>The grade teachers sympathized with his desire to
bring up the standard of the school, and promised to
do as he directed. There was no trouble in the grades
<span class='pageno' id='Page_795'>795</span>when the discontinuance was announced. In the high
school, anticipating a general epidemic of truancy if
he announced his revolutionary policy before the noon
recess, Mr. Frank told his fifty-five pupils to come
back at one o’clock, as he had a matter of general
interest to explain to them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thinking that some new scheme not effectively different
from the old one might be forthcoming the
fifty-five gathered as they were told. Mr. Frank
noted, as the bell rang, that they had left on their
coats and carried their caps in their hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>He told them first, as soon as they were quiet in their
seats, that there would be no Friday afternoon half-holiday.
He said that perfect attendance was expected
unless illness prevented it, and that no reward
would be given for it. After a full explanation of his
reasons he said that afternoon classes would begin in
five minutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The effect was electrical. Sam Poultney, a bully of
nineteen, who led the high school boys, sprang to his
feet. He was a boy not without ability, a boy of undisciplined
will and great physical courage. He faced
Mr. Frank now, fearlessly, perhaps sincerely feeling
that he defended a real right.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, they won’t!” he exclaimed. “You made us
come to school this afternoon by a dirty trick, and
we’re not going to stay. You can’t take our holiday
away from us that we earned by being here all week
and not tardy once. Come on, all of you!” and he
started for the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Frank saw a quick and vivid example of the
working of mob impulse. As the great, confident
<span class='pageno' id='Page_796'>796</span>leader of the high school boys made for the door, the
whole school rose and followed him, until a stream of
angry pupils surged toward him as he stood staunchly
before the only exit. Just as Sam reached the platform
near which he stood, Mr. Frank’s quick wit saved
the day. He knew that the action of a mob is largely
unconscious and wholly emotional and instinctive, and
he appealed to instinct skillfully—the instinct of self-preservation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop! Oh, stop!” he called, his white face set
sternly. “Don’t you see what you’re doing?” He
looked with wild eyes to the back of the room, as
though he saw a fearful spectre there. The crowd of
excited pupils, wholly under the control of whatever
leader might show himself strongest, followed his eyes,
turned around, and looked where he looked. Sam
turned with the rest, and in the second of his hesitating
inquiry, Mr. Frank gained the upper hand. His
voice was raised in authority; his anger—for he was
righteously angry—gave a threat to his words that
the pupils felt and heeded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Turn around and go to your seats this instant!”
he commanded. “Sam, walk to your seat! Turn
around, all of you. If I hear one word—”</p>

<p class='c007'>He stood like an avenging angel, a slight man, facing
a mob of angry pupils, and the dignity and confidence
of his attitude won the day. Sam started to mutter
threats and objections, but stopped when Mr. Frank
took one step toward him. Two or three girls began
to cry; then first one pupil and then another took his
books out slowly. The assistant, a girl fresh from
college, stood at one side of the room, bravely stifling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_797'>797</span>a temptation to indulge in hysterics. When he could
trust his voice, Mr. Frank said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The senior English class may pass.” The class
passed very meekly into their recitation room, and
Miss Spangler closed the door after her as she went
in with them. It was a sullen group of boys and girls,
however, that stayed with her that afternoon.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>In making so great a change in school policy as that
proposed by Mr. Frank, first secure the undoubted
backing of the school board. Make no announcement
until your course of action is fully arranged with
them and finally decided upon. If this can not be
done early in the week, follow the custom of the former
principal for the first week in giving the half holiday.
This last arrangement has two advantages. (1) It
gives the teacher a longer time to secure the confidence
of his pupils and (2) it gives the chance of making
the announcement before Friday afternoon comes, so
that it loses somewhat its element of shock, thereby
lessening the danger of a crisis.</p>

<p class='c007'>Have a thoroughly worked out plan in mind of some
pleasure which you can offer as a substitute for the
one you are taking away. Propose this just before
you make the announcement regarding Friday afternoon.
If the pupils’ minds are full of the thought of
some pleasure ahead, there is less room for the feeling
of rebellion to creep in.</p>

<p class='c007'>About Wednesday of the second week, ask the pupils
to put away books five or ten minutes before the usual
time, as you have an important announcement to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_798'>798</span>make. When all are in a position of attention, say,
with the air of one who has a pleasant surprise to
offer, “I’ve been wondering if we couldn’t think up
some jolly fun for Saturdays, for those whose attendance
has been perfect through the week. I understand
there are some very interesting remains of Indian settlements
about fifteen miles north of here. We’ve
just been studying about the inhabitants of the country
in the period when the colonists came. It would
be a good time to visit those remains of their old homes.
Most of you have autos, or have friends who would
lend you theirs. Suppose we get up a high school
party tomorrow. If we do, we’ll just make a day of it—take
our lunches along, roast our potatoes and make
our coffee down on the lake shore, and some of you
might like to take your fish poles along, or rifles, if you
have them. Possibly we could bag a few prairie
chickens for tomorrow’s dinner. The school board
met last Wednesday evening and decided that we were
to have school on Friday afternoons after this, but I
believe this trip would be more fun than having Friday
afternoon free. It leaves the girls out for this
week, but next week we’ll think up something that they
will enjoy. Sam, I’ll appoint you, and if you need
any help you may choose one other boy, to see if we
can get autos enough. Each of us will bring lunch
for one and we’ll serve it all together.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Get the minds of your pupils to working on the
new plan immediately and thus drain off into harmless
constructive action the emotions that otherwise
would vent themselves in mischief or rebellion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_799'>799</span>The particular form of pleasure here outlined is
suggested by the location of the incident narrated
above, namely in the Middle West. But each teacher
would, of course, choose the plan best suited to his
own location and the likings and circumstances of his
own school. Some teachers, for example, might prefer
to have movie entertainments for Friday evening, correlating
the pictures exhibited with the school subjects
studied. Or a social gathering on Friday evening
might be more appealing in some schools—something
good to eat, a little music, a few games and a good
time all round. The papers the children have prepared
during the week might be exhibited on a long
table for parents to examine. The girls would take
great pride in helping to serve refreshments.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Such situations as faced Mr. Frank in the oil town
are growing less common as time passes; in frontier
towns they occurred frequently. Sometimes they occur
still; and blessed is that school whose teacher, in such
a crisis, possesses quick wits, a knowledge of psychology,
and dauntless courage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Frank did well to check the pupils as he did,
when once the school had reached the state of insubordination
indicated in the story above, but he was
very seriously at fault in allowing the school to reach
that stage. His arbitrary handling of the situation
undoubtedly was a victory, but it was the kind of victory
which assuredly would breed contempt and resentment
and plotting to “get even” with the man
who had tricked the pupils into an extra half day of
study.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_800'>800</span>In depriving the pupils of what they regarded as a
great privilege he should have had a substitute plan
which would have eased somewhat the disappointment
of the pupils. In this plan he should have retained
his rightful place as leader and thus by coöperating
heartily in the pleasure of the pupils, should have
fully demonstrated to them that he desired only their
welfare.</p>

<p class='c007'>So regulating a school as to <i>prevent</i> a crisis is a
higher type of administrative ability than allowing
crises to come, and then meeting them with drastic
measures, even though they seemed successful.</p>

<p class='c007'>Occasionally it happens, even in good schools, that
a student commits an act so serious as to justify his
being turned over to the juvenile or other court. In
such a case the principal may sometimes find it to his
advantage to coöperate with the court in trying to
reclaim an unusually bad and daring boy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Extreme Cases</div>

<p class='c007'>Paul Thompson and Stephen Longman lived in a
rapidly growing frontier town in the West. They had
the name of being reckless boys, and all through their
school days had caused more or less trouble to their
teachers and classmates. The boys especially disliked
Mr. Black, the teacher who had charge of the assembly
study room. He was strict in his requirements and
very severe in reprimands, and these boys had frequent
occasions to feel the force of both. One evening when
Mr. Black was scheduled to give a lecture to the school,
Stephen said to Paul, “Let’s stiffen up Blackie’s backbone
a bit, he’s too limp.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_801'>801</span>“What d’yer mean?” questioned Paul.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When he gets well to going tonight, you go to one
door of the assembly room and yell ‘Fire!’ at the top
of your voice and I’ll go to the other and do the same.
Let’s see how long he’ll keep his dignity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The program was carried out to the letter. Suddenly,
in the midst of the lecture, rang out the cry,
“Fire! Fire!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The frightened students rose in a body and rushed
for the door. In vain Mr. Black tried to control their
movements. His voice was drowned in the uproar.
In the desperate scramble for the doors that followed,
many were injured, one or two so seriously as to require
hospital treatment. Several others fainted. All
were shocked and, of course, the meeting was broken
up. It was soon discovered that the whole thing was
a joke, but the harm was done. It could not be undone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is only one thing more I can do for you,
boys,” said the principal, as he talked with them in
his office the next day. “Your offense is so serious that
it is necessary to turn you over to the courts. I am
going to make one more effort to help you, however,
in the hope that it may save you from a term in the
Reformatory. I have asked the judge to pronounce
your sentence, then place you on probation, thus allowing
you to finish your school course. Your only
alternative is to be given over unreservedly to the
courts. Which do you prefer?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We prefer to stay here. We never meant that all
those people should get hurt, Mr. Wells,” said Stephen.
“We just thought we’d scare them a little.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_802'>802</span>“We will go now over to the court house. I have
already arranged with Judge Sinclair to meet you
there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Judge Sinclair listened to the boys’ story with great
seriousness, and after pointing out to them the legal
aspects of their misdemeanor, said, “As a special favor
to your principal, with whom I have already conferred,
I shall give you one more chance. I have appointed
Professor Black your probation officer, with
absolute authority over you.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The court decides that you shall discipline yourself
by submitting implicity to the commands of
others, and it is only through this severe discipline
that you will become men. The probation I shall order
is not going to be for your pleasure. You will submit
to rough fare and to all the privation and discipline
of prison without going to prison. You will be punished
with hard work and regular living until you
grow to like it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The probation was to be considered broken if the
boys:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>Used liquors or tobacco in any form.
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>Entered a poolroom or saloon.
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>Disobeyed the probation officer.
    </dd>
    <dt>&#160;</dt>
    <dd>Attended a movie, or went out nights without the probation officer’s consent.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c007'>The officer was enjoined to see that the boys worked
hard in school and made all their grades. They must
stay at home evenings and conduct themselves quietly
at all times. They were recommended to go to church
twice every Sunday.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_803'>803</span>The probation period was to continue until the
court issued further orders.</p>

<p class='c007'>The serious consequences of their rash sport, the
severity of the judge, and the narrow escape from the
reformatory, sobered the boys. They kept their probation
and graduated two years later, having won
back at last the forfeited respect of their teachers and
classmates.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. Submitting to Conventionalities</p>

<p class='c007'>Probably a good many persons older than the two
boys named below would be puzzled to explain many of
the conventions which they, nevertheless, implicity
obey. It is one of the curious manifestations of the
regulative instinct that we yield such humble submission
to what are oftentimes meaningless customs. On
the other hand, this imitative sort of regulation of
one’s habits may often lay a foundation for desirable
conduct where a rational method applied in the beginning
would have failed utterly. The danger is that
when the questioning period arrives there may be only
superficial answering of the oft-repeated question,
“Why?”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 144 (FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADES)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Why Remove Hats?</div>

<p class='c007'>Leonard and Karl Rosenbush were two sturdy little
rationalists of ten and twelve years. They despised
poetry, utterly rejected fairy stories, and took a strictly
scientific view of life generally. They belonged to a
family of culture and refined tradition, and their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_804'>804</span>attitude amused their father greatly, while it reduced
their mother to despair. She was often unable to give
them the reasons they demanded for what she had
always accepted without a question.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Forbes, their teacher, was one day giving her
room a lesson in good manners. They were discussing
modes of salutation when Karl raised a vigorous protest
to taking off his hat to women.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, now, <i>why</i> do we have to take off our hats to
women any more than to men?” he asked. “I don’t
see why they’re so terribly good they have to be treated
like a church.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, Karl, I never heard of such ideas. Doesn’t
your father take off his hat to women?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, and he can’t give any more reason than you
can. All he did when I asked him was to laugh and
say I mustn’t be a barbarian. I’d rather be a barbarian
than to do such a senseless thing, anyway.
Women aren’t any better than men.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Karl, I want you to take off your hat to women
now, and when you’re a man you’ll know the reason
why.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s it, put me off with ‘when I’m a man!’
Father said that, too. But if there is any reason, why
can’t you tell me now? It’s just like Santa Claus—there
isn’t any, and only little kids and girls believe
it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Leonard nodded a vigorous amen to his brother’s
heterodoxy, and Miss Forbes let the matter drop because
she did not know how to meet Karl’s arguments,
although she was sure he was wrong. The two boys
took a mischievous delight in passing her and other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_805'>805</span>teachers on the street without lifting their caps or
even touching them.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>The child of a rationalistic temperament must be
met with reasons; if a thing is right there are always
good reasons for it, and these may be fully or partially
explained to any child who is old enough to inquire
for them. In Karl’s case, both parents and teacher
should have given him the true reasons for the chivalrous
regard for women which is symbolized and expressed
in the raising of hats. An intelligent boy of
ten should begin to rationalize the good manners which
in earlier childhood are pure habit.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Forbes might pleasantly have answered Karl,
that the ceremony to which he objected is a conventionalized
expression of the regard men have for
women. “You love your mother, don’t you? She
does more for you that you can repay, doesn’t she?
Now, all other right-minded boys and men feel the
same way about their mothers. And so they all agreed,
a long time ago, that they would pay this mark of
respect to women.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This explanation would serve very well for the
school, but it would be wise to have a private talk with
Karl and explain to him more fully the considerations
that underlie all chivalrous customs. Put upon a basis
of rationalized justice, the custom of hat-raising will
win hearty support from Karl, but as a mere matter
of unexplained tradition it makes no appeal whatever
to him.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_806'>806</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>We have here a case where the love of approbation,
strong enough in the average child to be used in fixing
a good habit, does not function. Karl does not care
enough for the approbation of parents, teacher or
friends to make him do a thing not approved by his
reason. The incident is inserted here because it is
exceptional and illustrates the occasional case in which
the love of approbation can not be used as an incentive.
As a rule, the love of approval, of being considered
“a gentleman” or “a little lady,” is strong
enough to give all the motivation necessary for teaching
good manners.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (EIGHTH GRADE)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Hendrickson taught in the town of Ridgeway,
where the leading industries were carried on in factories
of various kinds. Nearly all the parents worked
in some one of these. Naturally, with their long hours
of work, these parents had little time for such secondary
matters as polishing their children’s manners.
Most of them were thankful if they could feed the
hungry youngsters and provide a place where they
could sleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Hendrickson soon became aware that the matter
of teaching good manners devolved upon her exclusively.
She also felt that a direct attack upon the
rude customs of her pupils would be less effective than
indirect procedure, since refined manners in this particular
community usually resulted in having the
scornful epithet, “Stuck-up!” attached to the possessor
of said manners.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Interest in Manners</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_807'>807</span>After careful deliberation, Miss Hendrickson decided
to take advantage of the story period in laying
the foundation for more explicit teaching of manners
later. Accordingly, she began the story of the feudal
system and the institution of chivalry that sprang
from it, a story always appealing to seventh and eighth
grade pupils. She told how the feudal lord had to
build strong castles for the safety of his family in
those days of warfare. She vividly portrayed life
in the castle, and showed how women also often had
to do brave, daring acts in defending the castle when
the husband was away. She explained how little boy
pages were trained to wait on the ladies of the castle
and to be polite to them, and how, when these same
boys were older and became knights their highest
duty was to protect these women who had few neighbors
and who were shut up much of the time in the
castles because it was unsafe to go abroad, and how
the women returned this care by making the homecoming
a very happy time for the lords and husbands
whenever they came back from war. As the story progressed
from day to day, Miss Hendrickson developed
the thought that this sort of life in the castle gradually
changed in many ways the ideals and habits of the
people. Poetry and music, for other than religious
purposes, began to be written and sung, and the rude
people who had formerly laughed at refinement in
manners as something effeminate and unsuited to a
warrior, began to realize after a while that a man
could be brave and strong, yet at the same time be
gentle and polite toward women and toward all who
were weaker or more dependent than himself. So, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_808'>808</span>time, the lords began to vie with each other to see
who could be most polite or who could render the
greatest service to his lady.</p>

<p class='c007'>Chivalry sprang up, and, indeed, died out, many
hundreds of years ago, yet it still has an influence
over us, for we still use the term lady, not meaning
now, exclusively, the wife of a lord, but any woman
who is worthy of our respect. And a chivalrous man
is still a man who is polite to women, and who always
springs to their defense whenever they need protection.
Gentlemen in those days meant a lord or someone
of high birth. But such men had more refined
manners than had the other people, or serfs, as they
were called, having been trained in chivalry; and
today we use the term in this country to mean any
man who has fine manners.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course Miss Hendrickson told the story very
much more in detail than has been done here. She
dwelt upon phases which she knew would strongly
appeal to the children and illustrated them with many
pictures borrowed from the library. She had the children
bring in baskets of stones from the river bank
and asked two of the boys who had the most offensive
manners to build a miniature castle on the sand table.
She read a few of the poems sung by the minnesingers
and troubadours, and the oath which the squires must
take before they could be dubbed knights.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this time Miss Hendrickson had said very little
about the personal manners of her pupils, but she had
substituted a new ideal regarding the desirability of
good manners for the crude one generally held by her
pupils. She had made such manners seem attractive,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_809'>809</span>and thereafter when a child was about to do some act
which she could not approve, she would often say,
“What would a knight do, James, in such a case?”
and many times the suggestion was sufficient to induce
the desired conduct.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. Submitting to State Control</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 145 (EIGHTH GRADE)</h4>

<p class='c016'>The Longfellow School was situated in one of the
most congested foreign settlements of one of our largest
and most cosmopolitan cities. Very few of the
parents of the pupils could speak any but the most
broken English. Many made no attempt to converse
in the difficult language of the strange new world to
which they had come.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Saluting Flag</div>

<p class='c007'>The board of education was particularly anxious
that the children of these foreign parents should be
trained in appreciation of American institutions and
in reverence for the American Flag, with all it stands
for. They requested that all the national holidays
should be made the occasion of special programs to
which parents should be invited and that each afternoon
when the schools were dismissed each pupil
should salute the flag both verbally and with the hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most of the children entered into the custom without
demur, but one boy of fifteen, Hans Neuhaus, refused
to give the salute.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hans, everyone is expected to give the salute,”
said his teacher, William Hoover. “Once more, now.”
Still Hans remained silent.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_810'>810</span>“Hans, I wish you to give the salute with the
others.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t believe in saluting the flag,” said Hans.
“It isn’t my flag, anyhow. I’m not going to salute
that flag.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hans, you must salute it,” said the now exasperated
teacher. “The board requires it, and if you do
not obey we can not have you in this school.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right, then. I’ll go,” and Hans cooly took
his books from his desk and walked out.</p>

<p class='c007'>Three days later, as Hans did not reappear at the
school, he was arrested for truancy and taken before
the juvenile court. Under the coercion of the court
he was made to return to the school and to give the
daily salutes.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Try a roundabout way of getting at Hans’ difficulty.
For a little while, at least, appear not to notice that
he is not joining with others. Meanwhile, in the story
period, or in the history class study, in a simple and interesting
way, tell the history of the flag and the principles
for which it stands. Imagine yourself in Hans’
place—that is, that you are a foreigner in a strange
land, and that it is the flag of another country that
you are asked to salute. What considerations would
make you willing to do it? When this question is
answered in your own mind, then set out to win the
allegiance of Hans.</p>

<p class='c007'>Keep watch on the playground to see if some of
Hans’ hostility has not been caused by unkind teasing
on the part of other children.</p>

<div>

  <h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Only the outward form of loyalty can be brought
about by force. Mr. Hoover forgot that only an intelligent
understanding and appreciation can be the
basis of true loyalty, and these require time in which
to develop. He should be more concerned, then, in
the conditions favorable to a steady growth of these
attitudes than about mere compliance to outward, conventional
form. Saluting the flag and honoring the
flag may be two quite different acts.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (THIRD GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Honoring the Flag</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Beardsley, of the Lincoln School in Newport,
taught her class, by many little talks and allusions to
venerate the ideals of the national flag rather than the
flag itself. “Only noble-hearted persons have a right
to stand under that flag,” she often said. Then, when
some especially praiseworthy act had been performed
by any child during the day, she would call that one
forward to stand under the flag that was gracefully
draped in the corner of her school-room, while the
others gave the salute just before going home at the
close of the day’s session. The children soon began
to vie with each other, in helping a younger child, in
being polite, keeping desks tidy—anything that would
especially entitle them to stand under the flag—the
greatest honor the teacher could confer. Thus the
pupils learned to associate true patriotism, so far as
a young child could understand it, with the symbol of
state control.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_812'>812</span>8. Self-Regulation</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) <i>Wise choices in human relationships.</i> Sooner
or later in the life of every normal child, the more or
less arbitrary control of parent and teacher must give
way to self-regulation of conduct. Happy is that boy
or girl who has been unconsciously practiced in self-control
and wise choosing before that day comes when
he no longer has a wise counselor at hand in life’s
startling emergencies.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 146 (HIGH SCHOOLS)</h4>

<p class='c016'>“Well, you’re going to the gayest place on the coast,
and when you come back in the fall I shall expect you
to bring us some startling ideas for our winter fun,
Constance. Do see if you can’t pick up something
really new. We’ve done the same old thing so long,
you know! Well, goodbye. Have a good time!”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Choosing Companions</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Osgood stood on the platform and waved her
handkerchief to the Yule children and their delicate
little mother, who were off for Greenwood Beach for
the month of August. The Yule young people were
much flattered by Miss Osgood’s attention, for she was
a young matron in a very fashionable private “finishing
school” for young ladies. She was also quite a
favorite in the society outside of the school, as well
as the organizer of all the social functions within it.
Constance, especially (who at eighteen had just finished
high school and would be “coming out” next
winter), thought she was a lucky girl to have Miss
Osgood notice her in such a way as to indicate that it
would be possible for her to suggest valuable ideas to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_813'>813</span>Miss Osgood’s fertile mind. Inwardly she resolved
that if any startling ideas were floating around at
Greenwood Beach, she would bring them back and lay
them at Miss Osgood’s feet. Her brother Clarence, a
sophomore at college; Helen, who was a high school
sophomore, and Kenyon, just finishing grammar
school, were as eager as Constance for good times; but
Constance was the leader, and as her mother was
not strong enough thoroughly to oversee her children’s
lives, Constance led the others in whatever they
did.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you dear—it’s so lucky you came tonight!”
one of her friends gushed, as they entered the hotel
which was to be their temporary home, late Saturday
afternoon. “We’re planning a coaching party for
all day tomorrow, and need two more to make up the
party. Won’t you and your brother go?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Constance reflected. She knew her mother, who
was at the desk arranging for rooms, would want them
to go to church the next day, and to rest after the
long trip. Still, going to church and resting gave
one no startling ideas, and it was certainly not having
“a good time.” So she consented, and later cajoled
her reluctant mother into a grudging consent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having started out with the idea of social gayety
rather than of rest and recreation, Constance soon
became a leader in the gayest life at the hotel. She
even planned the champagne supper at the old sailors’
tavern, which was written up in the New York papers.
Her old friends, the wholesome girls with whom she
had tramped and gone swimming in previous summers,
soon found that she had no time for them, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_814'>814</span>began to avoid her. The month resolved itself, for
her and Clarence and Helen, into a feverish rush of
engagements. Constance came home in September
tired and sophisticated, but full of those sensational
ideas that Miss Osgood had said she wanted. She met
Miss Osgood at a tea before long, and hoping to gain
her notice and become her companion, she regaled the
ladies present with a lively account of her summer’s
gayety.</p>

<p class='c007'>After she had gone, there was a little silence. Then
Miss Osgood said to the other women:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Isn’t it a pity the Greenwood Beach should have
spoiled Constance so? She was such a sweet girl last
summer, and now she seems like a jaded old society
belle, and a belle not too particular as to her companions
at that. I suppose she’ll be the rage this winter,
but I shall rather steer clear of her.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Constance’s case calls for the application of the
principles of suggestion and of initiative in coöperation.
See to it that no young person who has been
under your influence for a period of months or years
goes to a new and different world without trying to
indicate to that person how he or she may get the best
rather than the worst out of the novel experience. A
little conversation as to the purpose of the trip, a few
suggestions as to the interesting places that may be
visited, a little reading together of the historical or
other literature connected with the new field, a helpful
word as to how the trip may be made beneficial to the
friends who are not fortunate enought to enjoy such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_815'>815</span>pleasures, may give direction to ambitions which otherwise
will expend themselves upon unworthy ends.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Girls and boys in the adolescent period are possessed
of so many conflicting ideals that they may be
turned in any one of half a dozen directions at a
psychological moment. Just at the time when Constance
was feeling very grown up, and was looking
forward to a very vivid experience of some kind, Miss
Osgood thoughtlessly dropped the suggestion which
colored all of Constance’s thoughts and acts during
her vacation. Instead of trying to gain Miss Osgood’s
approbation she should have spent her month in growing
strong and brown in the open air, in helping to
make the life at the hotel simple and wholesome and
health-building; but Miss Osgood’s influence all went
the other way.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is important that even chance acquaintances
watch their casual injunctions to young people, not
only because they may have so much more influence
than they dream, but also because they may speak at
a time when the mind of the hearer is peculiarly sensitive
to suggestion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Wise Choice</div>

<p class='c007'>Dodge Monroe was changing from the East High
School to the Sidney Lanier, because his parents were
moving farther out in the suburbs. A few nights
before they left for their new home, the Claytons
gave the Monroes a farewell dinner, and Dodge, much
to his delight, was included in the invitation. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_816'>816</span>was his first dinner party, and in his new Tuxedo he
felt very grown up and manly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Over the salad Mr. Clayton turned to Dodge, who
was beginning to feel a bit left out of the grown
people’s conversation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you change now to the Sidney Lanier High
School?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir. I start there next Monday.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know they’re sorry to lose you in the East, but
you’ll make an equally good record in Sidney Lanier.
And it must be an inspiration to any boy to attend a
school named after such a man. He could hardly be
unworthy, having such an example of manhood always
before him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dodge knew nothing about Sidney Lanier, but this
aroused his curiosity, and on Sunday afternoon he
went to the branch library and read up on Sidney
Lanier. As the details of that brave and beautiful life
became real to him, he found himself measuring his
own character by the standard of Lanier’s. He took
out Lanier’s “<cite>Boy’s Froissart</cite>” to read.</p>

<p class='c007'>That week he met dozens of new boys. Being frank
and strong, he was liked at once, and many acquaintances
offered. Some of the boys seemed all that boys
should be; others, he knew, his mother would not approve
as his friends. This thought came to him:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Back at East I’d just grown up with the fellows,
and knew everybody. Here there’s a bigger school,
and I can’t know them all. I’ll have to choose. If
I’m trying to make myself like Sidney Lanier, why
not try some such test in regard to the fellows?”</p>

<p class='c007'>This is what Dodge did, more or less consciously.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_817'>817</span>Mr. Clayton’s admiration for a fine man, expressed
in the most casual way, had a determining effect upon
Dodge’s character.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) <i>Religious attitudes.</i> If regulation of conduct
between man and man must become eventually a matter
of individual choosing, in a still higher degree
must religious attitudes become an issue for self-regulation.
The teacher’s problem, then, is to throw about
the pupil a social environment which shall stimulate
the pupil’s highest ideals, but yet without encroaching
upon his individual liberty and responsibility.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 147 (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Grey was distressed at the lack of church-going
in the little town to which he had come as principal.
A very religious man himself, he never missed a service
and never failed to find satisfaction and help in

others. When, therefore, he observed that few of his
high school pupils attended the village church, he
resolved to talk to them about it.</p>

if you don’t at first.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was more of the same sort of appeal, to all of
which Mr. Grey’s pupils listened politely, for they
respected him highly, but none of which seemed to
swell the church attendance on Sunday. Although he
succeeded in other respects, in this one matter Mr.
Grey had to acknowledge that his efforts led nowhere.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Let the appeal for church attendance, like many
others, be based on interest. All young people like
company, action, color and music; therefore, most
little children like Sunday School, but when they
reach an age at which the church does not offer them
these inducements, they are likely to stop unless kept
in by family influence. Make your appeal according
to the age of your pupils and their tastes.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Grey talked to his pupils of things they knew
little or nothing about. This world is very real to
the young; the next world is very shadowy and hypothetical.
The only persons whom Mr. Grey’s appeal
would reach would be those pupils who had been
brought up with religious training—<i>i. e.</i>, the children
who would not need it. In separating education and
religion, time and eternity, mind and soul, he used
outworn and abandoned conceptions of things, foreign
alike to modern thoughts and to pupils’ knowledge.
In assuming that they would not like it at first, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_819'>819</span>frightened them away from the duty urged upon
them.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Tate, teaching also in one of the small towns in
which church-going was out of fashion, said to his
boys and girls:</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Correlate Church and School</div>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Corithers told me that he was going to preach
about Phœnician ships next Sunday. I wondered how
he could make a sermon out of that subject, but he
wouldn’t tell me. As we’ve just been studying about
this matter, I suggest that we all hear this sermon
Sunday, and then we’ll discuss it Monday.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He and Mr. Corithers had talked over ways and
means, and had together planned a series of sermons
that should correlate with some of the school work
being done. They planned to have simple and dignified
music, and talk little about eternity until the
young people had been led far enough in the spiritual
life to know they had souls. The services, concrete
and beautiful, and the sermons, which were planned
to reach their hearers, were attended and enjoyed by
Mr. Tate’s pupils.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Tate did not urge his pupils to go to church
without a conviction that they should do so, and a
knowledge that they would hear something they could
understand. He and the minister planned earnestly
and well to get results, and won.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 148 (PRIVATE SCHOOL)</h4>

<p class='c016'>“Well, what do you think of the girls by this time?”
The kindly old president looked hard at Miss Swallow,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_820'>820</span>who had just finished her second month as a teacher
in a girls’ private school.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think they are lovely girls, and I like to work
with them,” she replied. “With one exception, they
could hardly be better.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“With one exception? And what is that?”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Time for Bible</div>

<p class='c007'>“The matter of piety. This is a church school, and
yet I feel a real lack of a spirit of devotion among
the girls. When I visit their rooms, I see all sorts of
books in evidence except the Bible. When I attend
the Y. W. C. A. meetings, it seems to me that most of
the girls give evidence of a very superficial sort of
religious experience.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What you say is true. I have often thought of it
myself. But what can we do? I urge the girls not to
neglect their spiritual interests, in chapel. And every
Lent we have special meetings.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll study the situation a little and tell you what
I think about it, Dr. Dayton.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do, please. I am anxious to better things if I can.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In a few days Miss Swallow was back in the president’s
office.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I’ve found the reason for the trouble,”
she said, “and the remedy is simple. We expect our
girls to grow strong here, and so provide them a gymnasium
and a tennis court, and give them time for
exercise. We expect them to eat, and provide a meal
time; we expect them to sleep, and make them put
out their lights and go to bed. But we expect them
to cultivate the spiritual life without providing any
special time for it. There is not even a five-minute
period for devotions and quiet during the day.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_821'>821</span>“But girls say their prayers and read their Bibles
at night, don’t they?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, if they do it at all. They do it when they are
tired with the long day’s work and play, and their
attention is not particularly drawn to it by any stipulated
time set aside for devotions. I think we should
emphasize our idea of the importance of devotions by
giving it time during the day.” She outlined a plan,
and they agreed to try it in the winter term.</p>

<p class='c007'>They provided a fifteen-minute “quiet time” just
before breakfast, which every girl was expected to use
in meditation and prayer. After a time they changed
it to fifteen minutes after breakfast, before classes
began; this worked much better. Girls who had never
given any time to devotions now found a time provided,
and a lack of distractions which suggested a
compliance with the expectation. Girls who had always
wanted to, but could never find time, now began
systematically to study the <cite>New Testament</cite> or the
“<cite>Imitation</cite>.” There was no compulsion about it, but
the suggestion of the definite provision for the cultivation
of the inner life bore abundant fruit in lives
made gracious by its growth.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 149 (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Religious Perplexities</div>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Horne had won the respect and devotion of the
high school boys by his efficient and conscientious
coaching of the athletic teams. Therefore, it was not
strange that one of the boys, Donald Hope, came to
him one day after school, and, after much hesitation,
plunged into a discussion of religious faith.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, our minister says we ought to believe,” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_822'>822</span>said, “and I don’t see how we’re to believe a thing
that we never saw or felt or heard, but that people
just tell us is so. It isn’t scientific. I don’t want to
be wicked, you know—he says you’re condemned if
you don’t believe; but how’s a person to believe when
he doesn’t?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Home was greatly puzzled by this question,
and much troubled as well. He hardly knew whether
to attempt to answer it or not; finally, he decided he
would better not.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You ask Mr. Curtis about it, Donald,” he said.
(Mr. Curtis was the minister whose teaching Donald
had reported.) “You see, I’m a public school teacher,
and we are not allowed by law to teach religion. Besides,
I’ve never thought much about such matters,
and I might tell you wrong.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Donald went away with a heavy heart. Mr. Home
was the one person in whom he had faith enough to
take to him this big and serious question, and he had
failed him. He did not think for a moment of going
to Mr. Curtis, who was elderly and inclined to be dogmatic.
He resolved to wait until chance might bring
him an explanation of his difficulties.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>“Never fail to help where help is needed.” Even
if giving help involves research into new fields, this is
a good ideal for teachers to live up to.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Horne, finding himself unable to help Donald,
should have promised him at least to think about
the matter, and the two might have discussed it freely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_823'>823</span>and in sympathetic sharing of a difficulty which most
people have faced at some time or other.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>There is nothing unlawful or wrong in helping students
with their personal difficulties, religious or otherwise,
if this is done outside the classroom and outside
of school hours. On the other hand, it is a very serious
thing indeed to fail to help a human being who needs
help.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rationalizing of faith is not so insuperable a
difficulty as it appears to be when one first faces it.
There are a number of books dealing with the question,
and these Mr. Horne might have found and read,
both for his own sake and for Donald’s. The whole
structure of civilization is built on faith, and religious
faith is but a higher form of that which children have
in their parents or pupils in teachers.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 160 (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Saintly Recluse</div>

<p class='c007'>She was an anemic-looking girl of fifteen, her pretty
brown hair pulled tightly back and braided with Puritanic
neatness, her thin little body clad in the most
severe of gingham frocks. Miss Corliss noticed her
the first day, noted her letter-perfect recitation in
English and her aloofness from the other students,
and wondered what her story was.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a few days the Juniors came to Miss Corliss for
advice and help in planning their fall frolic. When
they came to the business of assigning committees,
she made a special plea that Susan should be given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_824'>824</span>some work to do, as she wanted to see her on friendlier
terms with her classmates.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Susan White? Oh, she’ll never have anything to
do with the parties. She thinks they’re wicked. She
stays at home and reads the Bible all the time, Miss
Corliss.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But if you ask her, won’t she help with the work
and come to the party?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, Miss Corliss, we’ve tried it. We used to invite
her but she always turned us down, and now we don’t
bother. Her mother is kind of crazy about religion,
I guess, and Susan is growing to be just like her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Corliss talked to Susan and found her sweetly
frank about her views. She was in no sense “crazy,”
but she had been led to a piety unusual in one so young,
through the influence of her widowed mother, who
had found consolation for bereavement in extreme devotion.
Susan, feeling it her duty to devote herself
to her mother, had gladly denied herself the usual
pleasures of youth and found real joy in her asceticism.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What can you do for her?” the principal, Mr.
Waiting, asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do for her? I shall not do anything for her—she
doesn’t need anything done for her. She is not abnormal;
she is only unusual. She is one of the happiest
girls in school, but she is one of the occasional
people, very occasional nowadays, who find their whole
happiness in a very personal, mystic type of religious
service. To try to make her over to be like the other
girls would be a great mistake.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But this isn’t the age of the religious recluse, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_825'>825</span>“Yes, I know. That’s why one mustn’t interfere
with them. If she were living in the time of Saint
Francis or of Jonathan Edwards, I should suspect
that her saintliness was copied from a model too often
urged upon her. As it is, she keeps to her mysticism
and asceticism in spite of every suggestion to the contrary
here at school. I shall watch her for signs of
unhealthfulness, but as yet I don’t see any. She has
as much right, you know, to develop her talent for
religious devotion as Stanley Brand has to develop his
for mechanics.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never thought of it in that light. Well, probably
you’re right, only, as you say, be on the lookout
for signs of a pathological development.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Corliss is to be commended for her attempt
to interest Susan’s classmates in her behalf. It is unfortunate,
however, that she dropped the matter upon
learning that Susan herself preferred to be left out
of their sport. There is no incompatibility between
innocent fun and a devoted religious life. To sacrifice
entirely the one is to make the other onesided in its
development. Sunshine as well as shadow is necessary
for healthy growth in any of the <i>higher</i> types of life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Susan’s habit of isolating herself from her associates
might easily become so fixed as greatly to injure
her future prospects in life. Coöperation, rather than
isolation, is to be the watchword of the future and
ability to coöperate with one’s fellows can be learned
only through actual experience—an experience that
Susan was failing to get.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_826'>826</span>Finally, Susan’s own physical health required a
more vigorous and varied type of life. It is highly
significant that the account, as it comes to us, describes
Susan as anemic. This pathological condition
of the body was undoubtedly, in part at least, both
cause and effect of Susan’s mental attitude—one by
no means to be encouraged to the exclusion of all recreative
activities. If not strong enough to indulge
in the more vigorous sports of her classmates, Susan
should at least be led to feel it incumbent upon herself
to share in such activities as did not tax her strength
too severely.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The issues that gather around sex interests of children
and young people are numerous, vexatious and
unceasingly important.</p>

<p class='c007'>A sane teacher does not disclose a morbid concern
in sex affairs, neither does he avoid dealing with insistent
problems. In fact, he proceeds much as does a
sympathetic father with his son or daughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Naturally any effective disciplinary measures must
be supported by accurate information as to the nature
of sex life and sex actions of children. The administrator
must know a great deal more than he tells; he
is never to be surprised by disclosures of sexual misconduct.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Objectionable Games—Unconscious
Sex Attraction</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 151 (EIGHTH GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>“Three Deep”</div>

<p class='c007'>Prof. Walsh, principal of Burrell High School, observed
his pupils playing a game called “Three Deep.”
This game, played by the boys and girls together and
calling for choices of confederates to be made, seemed
to him to lead to romance and he therefore talked
against it. He finally demanded that the pupils quit
playing this game altogether.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_830'>830</span>Attaching more importance to the game than it
really merited, the pupils played it all the more after
school hours.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Walsh should have led the pupils to enjoy another
game and should have said nothing about the one
he disliked. Having decided upon what to substitute
for this one he should say: “I know of a game I believe
you will all enjoy. I will show you how it is played.”
To insure enthusiasm in the new play he should speak
to two or three of the leaders among the pupils, a day
or two before the game is introduced, saying, “I know
of a fine game that I think we ought to play here; as
soon as I find time I will teach it to you. You are
quick to see into a new proposition, so I want you to
help me get it started as soon as you understand how
it is played.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>By the enlistment of the interest of several pupils
you are more likely to make a success of your new
game. If pupils have plenty of chance to play together
in wholesome activities they will be much more
likely to take a matter-of-fact view of association with
opposite sexes than if their attention is called to the
harmful qualities of a game and they are then asked
to stop playing it. The forbidden is alluring to high
school pupils and to young children alike. Therefore,
without reference to the often-played game, the
teacher should substitute a better one in its place.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Prize Athletics</div>

<p class='c007'>In the gymnasium of the Bradley High School the
students introduced social dancing during intermissions.
Mr. Burgess, the principal, understood well
the favorable attitude of some of his patrons toward
dancing. He, therefore, as a counter attraction, organized
two athletic clubs in the school, one for girls
and one for boys.</p>

<p class='c007'>He offered small prizes to the best shot-putter,
runner, walker, vaulter, etc., the prizes to be given in
the following May on a field day, the gate receipts of
which would pay for the prizes. The girls were offered
prizes in archery, tennis and croquet and were asked
to train two opposing baseball teams selected from
their numbers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Field day was a grand success. The health of the
pupils had been conserved and nobody but Mr. Burgess
himself knew the real reason why the clubs had
been organized.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION 2 (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Kissing Games</div>

<p class='c007'>The small high school at Lexington had fallen into
the deplorable habit of playing kissing games during
intermissions. Mr. Poe, the principal, decided to turn
the attention of the students into a less dangerous and
disgusting channel. He decided upon asking the
pupils to help beautify the school grounds and
buildings.</p>

<p class='c007'>He appointed two seniors to choose sides, so that
every pupil in the high school would be on one side or
the other. He then assigned the north half of the
buildings and grounds to one side. On fine days they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_832'>832</span>raked, mowed, planted flowers and vines, placed shrubs,
etc., on stormy days they planned interior decorations.
At the close of the school year a committee
from the town not only decided which side had done
best work, but declared that the pupils had gained
much practical knowledge and that the schoolhouse
and grounds had never looked so well before.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Sex Consciousness</p>

<p class='c007'>It is toward the end of the second year that boys
often begin to show tendencies toward evil habits.
This tendency does not appear because the boys of
themselves grow bad at this time; it is a matter of
imitation. In the country school the younger pupils
come in contact with older boys who lead them into
evil, and the same is true in villages and cities. It
might be that could the growing boy never come into
association with evil it would not become the teacher’s
necessity to use the fundamental principles in such a
way as to hold the boy’s confidence. It cannot be
denied that if he has the confidence of the boys he can
control them. No problem, however, requires greater
wisdom in the handling.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 152 (SECOND GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Sex Hygiene</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Marlowe, the second grade teacher at High
Falls, had noticed by Charlie Moncrief’s nervousness,
his sometimes vacant stare, and his frequent misuse
of his hands, that he needed to be taught on the subject
of sex hygiene, but she did not know how best to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_833'>833</span>bring about such instruction. So she kept up a continual
corrective set of admonitions like the following:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Charlie, be quiet and listen to this story.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Study your spelling, Charlie.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Charlie, come up here and stand by my desk.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And so throughout the year, Miss Marlowe ignored
the facts that ought to have led to a reformation of
this little boy’s habits.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>When a child shows he has not been given careful
teaching relative to sex hygiene, go to his mother
and advise her to take the child to a physician. Explain
the physical as well as the moral and mental
help it may be to the child to have one of two very
slight operations performed, after which, with proper
diet and bathing, the boy may easily forget his wrong
habits.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Children can best be taught at home on matters
of sex hygiene. This is especially true of children in
the lower grades. Mothers, as a rule, gladly respond
to a teacher’s or physician’s suggestions for improving
the health of their children.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION (FOURTH GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>School Nurse Instructs</div>

<p class='c007'>Miss Morris, a fourth grade teacher, called together
the mothers of her pupils and asked a trained nurse
who lived in the village to address them on sex hygiene.
After the talk, Miss Morris said: “The subject just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_834'>834</span>discussed is a most important one. I shall be very
glad, indeed, to make reports to any mothers whose
children, in my judgment, need attention relative to
this subject, if it is the wish of the mothers here present
for me to do so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A vote was taken and the mothers thus expressed
their desire to have such help as the teacher could
render. Thereafter she felt perfectly free to go to
them whenever it seemed necessary to discuss this
great subject, so pertinent to a child’s welfare.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 153 (FOURTH GRADE)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Vane saw a note fall upon Mary Pratt’s desk.
She said,</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mary, bring that note to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The child, she knew had not yet read the note.
Greatly embarrassed, Mary looked questioningly at
Clyde Mitchel before starting toward Miss Vane.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Improper Notes</div>

<p class='c007'>Contrary to the courtesy which teachers admonish
pupils to show, Miss Vane stood up, opened the note
and perused it in the presence of the school. While
she was looking at the note, Clyde Mitchel buried his
scarlet face in his book.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You wrote this note, didn’t you, Clyde?” asked
Miss Vane.</p>

<p class='c007'>Clyde only nodded “Yes,” and burrowed even
deeper into his book.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is a shameful note,” said Miss Vane. “It
contains words that no child should ever write or
speak. You may stay after school, Clyde.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The boys waited at the second corner from the school
house for Clyde after school.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_835'>835</span>In about ten minutes Clyde came running toward
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What did she do, Clyde?” they asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aw, nothing; she just preached a little and gave
me a few licks that wouldn’t hurt a baby.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What was in the note, anyway?”</p>

<p class='c007'>He told them exactly what was in the note, and a
loud “Hurray!” went up from the group of listeners.
The subject of conversation among these boys as they
went on down the street was as full of unclean words
and suggestions as the worst boys in the group could
think up.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>If you can not deal with sex subjects privately, with
pupils in the lower grades, do not deal with them at
all. Miss Vane made a mistake in reading or referring
to the note in the presence of others. In her
efforts to suppress such foul communications she occasioned
a talk upon the unnamable topics by all of her
own room and many in other rooms as well.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Public punishment of culprits who offend by talking
or writing on sex subjects only occasions more such
talk. It is like trying to quench fire by brandishing a
fire-brand which emits live sparks in every direction,
each one of which starts a conflagration.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Avoid Spreading Harm</div>

<p class='c007'>When Sadie Moore picked up a note from the floor
and handed it to Miss Dietz, who taught the third
<span class='pageno' id='Page_836'>836</span>grade, the teacher allowed no one to see her when she
read the note. She said privately to Sadie: “I desire
that you say nothing to any one about that note. That
is the best way to help me in this matter.” She studied
the handwriting and note paper and fixed the blame
to a certainty upon Conrad James. She resolved at
once to keep sharp eyes on that boy, unknown to him,
and to see that he had no chance to have unrestricted
conservation with other pupils for a while. She supervised
all play periods and thereby assured herself
that no harm should come to any one of her pupils
through association with him.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 154 (SEVENTH GRADE)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Morbid Sex-consciousness</div>

<p class='c007'>Pearl Goodwin’s mother was a widow of ill-repute in
the village. The eighth grade girls slighted Pearl
hourly. They avoided sitting with her whenever possible;
they gave her too wide a space at the blackboard
while the rest of them stood so close together as to
crowd their work; she went sadly to and from school,
walking alone, for none of the others would walk with
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>The teacher, Miss Terman, herself a native of the
village, understood, and made no effort to change the
situation.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day Pearl brought a shameful note to Miss
Terman, saying that she found it on her desk. Miss
Terman was shocked and made public inquiry as to
where the note came from. Some of the girls felt
sorry for Pearl and showed it by their attitude toward
her. The writer was not discovered. Every day, thereafter,
for a week, Pearl showed a similar note to Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_837'>837</span>Terman, and the mystery grew and with it sympathy
for Pearl. Daily Miss Terman made a speech about
the notes and asked help in finding out the writer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, in despair, she consulted the superintendent
of the school. When he heard the history of the
case he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I believe that Pearl herself is the writer of those
notes. Her mind has been poisoned on the sex subject
by taunts. I believe she is the only one in your room
who would write such notes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With this thought in mind, Miss Terman sought
evidence of Pearl’s guilt. She was not long in finding
the half leaves in Pearl’s tablet from which the paper
for the notes had been torn. She even found Pearl
writing a note, and got her pitiful confession of taking
this way to call attention and sympathy to herself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Terman sentenced Pearl to isolation for the
remainder of the school year (about two months).
She was compelled to take her seat as soon as she arrived
at school in the morning and at noon, to have a
separate recess from the others, and remain in her
seat after school closed until the other children had
time to reach their homes.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Terman should have drawn Pearl into the
games of the other girls early in the year. She should
have said to the leader among the girls, in private.
“You have it in your hands to make a classmate happy
or miserable. You, yourself, will enjoy school better
if no girl is made sad and lonely. I know that the
other girls will follow your lead and, therefore, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_838'>838</span>desire that you invite Pearl Goodwin into your school
games and give her an opportunity to know and like
good company.”</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Terman, by allowing the note-writing to be
publicly known, caused an epidemic of undesirable
talk in her school. She kept this in mind daily by her
isolation program for Pearl. It is only when all are
concerned in a question of this kind that a public talk
should be made on questions of sex.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Hygienic Toilet Rooms</div>

<p class='c007'>Enoch Fites found the disgraceful condition of the
toilet rooms belonging to his school to be a source of
great temptation and danger to his pupils. He first
solved the general problem of winning his pupils’
confidence. He was a master in quietly introducing
improvements in the school. For example, he secured
funds for a splendid clock, which was connected with
the Western Union Telegraph wires and was corrected
every hour. He established a manual training department
and set every boy in high school and in the
eighth grade at a bench.</p>

<p class='c007'>He opened up a domestic science department. He
organized tennis teams and put through a large
number of important measures.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the appropriate time came, he found no difficulty
in putting the toilet rooms for boys in a sanitary
condition and keeping them so. He remarked to a
visitor,</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_839'>839</span>“I have not inspected those rooms for two months,
but I know just how they are kept.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How in the world do you manage it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I put it up to my boys. I made the toilet rooms
entirely adequate for their needs and then put it up
to my boys to keep them clean. They have never
disappointed me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Meeting the Boy and Girl Question</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 155 (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<p class='c016'>When Mr. Harley went to take up his work as superintendent
of the Jamesville High School, he said to a
teacher who had served there the year before: “I
believe in preparedness—what was your greatest disciplinary
problem last year?”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>High School Parties</div>

<p class='c007'>“Parties, without a doubt,” she replied. “The last
party or the coming party occupied the minds of the
students to the exclusion of their studies. They were
out late at night and consequently did mediocre work,
even the brightest of them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Was nothing done to stop party going?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you see, many of the parents upheld the
pupils in what they called their social education, so
Mr. Turner (the former superintendent) didn’t try
to prohibit parties.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m glad to have this information,” replied Mr.
Harley.</p>

<p class='c007'>Later, when the pupils were known to be planning
a hallowe’en party, Mr. Harley announced that he
would suspend every pupil who attended any party
<span class='pageno' id='Page_840'>840</span>at any time during the school year, without first securing
his permission, and that such permission would
be given only very rarely.</p>

<p class='c007'>A storm of protest from the pupils was seconded
by several mothers, who called upon Mr. Harley to
discuss the social aspect of education.</p>

<p class='c007'>When, after a nerve-racking day, he told Mrs. Hines,
the leading society woman of the village, that he must
carry out his own plans <i>unaided by the parents</i>, he
unwisely aroused the opposition of so many of his
patrons that his work in Jamesville was very seriously
handicapped and he resigned at the end of his first
year there.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>A Parent-Teachers’ Club should be organized in
every school. Early in the year a meeting of the
club should be devoted to the discussion of out-of-school-hour
entertainments. The superintendent
should have the pros and cons presented before the
club by both parents and teachers. The teacher who
upholds parties should advise mothers to talk often
with their children upon the subject of desirable companions;
to forego all teasing of the sons and daughters
about “girls” and “beaux”; and to see to it that
the young people have wise chaperons.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>Much of the mischief that arises from parties is due
to parents. Realizing this to be the case, teachers
should find a way to talk to mothers about how to win
and hold the confidence of their children during the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_841'>841</span>trying high school period. The girls should also be
admonished by their teachers to talk to their mothers
freely about their social affairs.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION 1 (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Fanson was a high school teacher who was
justly admired by the girls under her care. She had
talked to the girls about the deference and homage
which they should show to their parents in social
matters. Alice Grant believed that Miss Fanson was
exactly right, hence was willing to act upon her
teacher’s advice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since she had entered high school, boys had suddenly
become very interesting to Alice. She blushed
one afternoon as she plucked up her courage to reveal
certain developments to her mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mother, the Freshmen are going to give a party,
and a boy in my German class has asked me to go.
May I?” Her voice affected indifference.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Retaining Control</div>

<p class='c007'>But Mrs. Grant knew her young daughter and saw
through that coolness. Her Alice was excited and
flushed and happy over a boy! And she stared blankly
for a moment as the realization forced its way. Then
a tempestuous refusal from a heart that resented her
little girl’s growing up sprang swiftly to her lips, but
she kept back the words. It did, indeed, hurt to have
Alice begin to be a young lady, but could even she,
the most adoring of mothers, restrain time and the
youth that was blossoming in her child?</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll have to think it over, Alice. I’ll tell you in
the morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And Alice went to her studying, confident that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_842'>842</span>whatever her mother decided, she would be just and
allow only big reasons to weigh with her.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Grant thought it over and that night talked it
over with her husband.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She’s absurdly young—only fifteen,” he objected.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, but absurdly natural, too, and strong in her
desires. I fear, if I refuse, it may only surround boys
with a mysterious glamour for her, and she might then
be tempted to associate with them in spite of me, and
any secrecy or deceit just now is dangerous. And you
know our Alice is growing pretty.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Grant regretted and bemoaned the loss of his
little girl, but agreed. “But who is this boy?” he
demanded. “Do you know him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. But I’m going to know all her friends from
now on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And next morning, when Alice, pink-cheeked and
eager-eyed, sought her mother’s decision, she welcomed
the “Yes” with a little squeal of delight.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I’ve been thinking, Alice,” her mother added,
“that I’d like to know the boys and girls you’re going
with. Wouldn’t you like to ask some of them over
here some evening before the party?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Would I? Well, rather! Mother, you’re a
dear.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what about a dress. I suppose you’d like a
new one?” Further question was stifled by an enthusiastic
hug.</p>

<p class='c007'>So they talked of the party and the dress, and then
it was not far to “the boys” and Alice’s new feeling
for them. And Mrs. Grant felt that the sweet intimacy
she was entering with this new daughter more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_843'>843</span>than compensated for the loss of the little girl, who had
suddenly become a young woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Alice returned from the party her mother
showed interest in each detail that her daughter related.
She remarked: “You must have had loads of
fun—what did you have to eat? What did you especially
like in the conduct of your classmates?” It is
while such concrete subjects are being discussed that
much guidance can be given the daughter in her formation
of opinions as to what is proper or improper
conduct. A teacher who brings about such intimacy
as this incident illustrates has done much for both
mother and daughter.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>ILLUSTRATION 2 (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<p class='c016'>Miss Canfield took hold of her work with genuine
interest as science teacher in the James Fisk High
School. Her knowledge of girl nature was sufficient to
save her from many blunders. Mary Turner was her
problem. A giddy set was overturning nearly all of
the constructive work done for her by her teachers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Canfield decided to go over matters with Mrs.
Turner, Mary’s mother. In the conversation, Mrs.
Turner saw where she must take a hand in Mary’s
affairs.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Overcoming Undesirable Influences</div>

<p class='c007'>There was no doubt but what Cecily Gregg, a classmate,
was having a bad influence on Mary. Mrs.
Turner rocked fitfully between stitches and remembered
how sweet and natural Mary had been before
she got so intimate with Cecily. But now she was
catching some of that young lady’s affected ways, and,
Mrs. Turner feared, some of her lack of modesty with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_844'>844</span>boy companions. Cecily was seventeen, and Mary, a
year younger, respected her opinions greatly, and
gloated over her popularity with certain overdressed
and rather sporty youths who took her about to picture
shows and ice cream parlors. Cecily was slowly
convincing Mary that theirs was the type to admire.</p>

<p class='c007'>And Mrs. Turner had unwittingly let Mary drift
so far from her influence of late, that she felt helpless.
She dared say nothing openly against Cecily. Mary
would only flare up in defense and stand more
staunchly for her friend. If she laid down rules,
Mary might secretly break them, and if she tried to
make subtle suggestions, the girl was certain to pounce
on her meaning and resent it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mary came home from school that day full of plans
for her birthday party.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cecily says I must get some new dance records for
the victrola. Ours are all passé. And I’m going to
make little crepe paper favors, by a cute pattern that
Cecily knows. And she wants me to ask Cousin Ralph.
Do you think he’d think us too young for him, since
he’s finished college? I’m crazy to have him meet
Cecily! He’ll be ‘dippy’ about her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>While Mary chattered, a thought lodged by Miss
Canfield came to Mrs. Turner. If she couldn’t influence
her daughter herself, unaided, she must reach
her through others.</p>

<p class='c007'>She answered: “Why, I think it would be lovely to
ask him, and I’m sure he’d like to come.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And so Mary wrote a cordial invitation to Cousin
Ralph and her mother quietly added a postscript that
night—a postscript that grew into an epistle as she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_845'>845</span>told her nephew, a clean-souled and manly young
fellow, of her problem about Mary.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can you help me?” she wrote. “A word from
you would weigh much with her. You’re her ideal of
young manhood. Let her see that you are not fascinated
by Cecily; she believes her irresistible. Say no
more than you can judge by seeing her at the party,
though. That will be enough.”</p>

<p class='c007'>His answer to Mary, his “sweet little cousin,” was
frank and warm. His answer to Mrs. Turner was
earnest and sympathetic. He would try.</p>

<p class='c007'>The great evening came, and with it a gay and
brightly dressed bevy of Mary’s friends. Some were
rollicking; some were bashful; but Mrs. Turner fancied
she saw the Cecily stamp on all of them. On all
except Evelyn Lewis, a simple, attractive girl with
fine manners. If Mary would only prefer her to
Cecily!</p>

<p class='c007'>Cousin Ralph arrived late and created a sensation,
for he was tall and good-looking and possessed of
polish and charm. He led all the fun after that and
Mrs. Turner saw Mary’s eyes sparkling with pride in
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>At a late hour the guests took their leave. But
Ralph, lingering after the others had left, talked over
the party with Mary and her mother, for the former
was too excited to want the evening to end.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did you like the girls?” Mary inquired,
eagerly. And just then Mrs. Turner found an excuse
to leave the room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very much, little cousin. They’re a jolly lot of
youngsters. And I’m quite struck with one of them.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_846'>846</span>“Oh, I knew you would be. Cecily, of course!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cecily! O, no!” His emphasis was expressive.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not Cecily?” Mary was bewildered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That would-be chorus girl with come-hither
eyes?” he demanded, and then, seeing her stricken
face, added hurriedly, “But maybe she’s a special
friend of yours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no,—that is,—not so very. But she’s awfully
popular.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“With only one kind of boys, then, and that’s not
the sort I’d like to see you running round with, cousin
mine. The girl that took my eye was—her name was—Evelyn.
She’s a peach. Ask me over some time
again when she’s here, will you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mary nodded a little uncertainly, and then promised.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mother,” she said, wonderingly, as Mrs. Turner
entered the room, “Ralph likes Evelyn. And she certainly
did look pretty tonight. I’m—crazy about her
myself!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And as Mrs. Turner squeezed her nephew’s hand,
she felt somehow that a new name was about to be
substituted for “Cecily” in Mary’s vocabulary.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Canfield listened attentively to the mother’s
report of the party and of Mary’s drift into better
companionship and naturally lent aid to the scheme
in a dozen little ways—assignments of team work,
comments to Mary on certain lovely qualities in
Evelyn and her type of girl, recommendation of books
and magazine articles, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mother and teacher accomplished an important
piece of work by this campaign in which they substituted,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_847'>847</span>in the unformed mind of a school girl, a correct
model of young womanhood in place of a degraded
type.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Falling in Love with the Teacher</p>

<p class='c007'>When pupils fall in love with their teachers, the
problem is not nearly so serious as the same event
would be out of school, for the reason that every normal
tradition of school relations is against such a state of
affairs. The teacher stands, as is said so often, <i>in loco
parentis</i>; and if teachers are fit to bear this relation
to their pupils, they can, and will, easily handle any
tendencies toward too intimate relations with their
pupils. The treatment for a pupil who develops too
ardent an admiration for a teacher is based upon the
process of de-personalizing the relations between them;
for almost always it will be found that when pupils
have fallen in love with their teachers, it is because,
purposely or unconsciously, the relations have been
too personal.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are two typical cases—that of young girls
who fall in love with an attractive young man teacher,
whom usually they hope to captivate and marry; and
that of boys, relatively less mature, who rarely reach
the ridiculousness of such plans, but shower such attentions
as they may upon the object of their affections,
and go to any length to please her. Most young
women teachers have the tact and good sense to manage
such cases wisely, keeping the boys within the bounds
of a normal and fairly platonic regard, and often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_848'>848</span>using their power to bring about the development of
a fine idealism and many manly virtues in their admirers.
But the vain young woman who likes this
kind of popularity is not unknown in schools; she is
a nuisance, doing more harm by her vanity than a
dozen sensible colleagues can undo through every
means known to good pedagogy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The teacher is to blame, as a rule, when either of
these conditions develops. Being older and more experienced,
he has the upper hand and can cure the
malady, if he will, especially as he has every sane tradition
on his side. The elimination of the dangerous
personal attitude, of opportunities for the expression
of regard, of the personal appeal, and of subtle suggestions
of a sentimental nature, are all in the power
of the teacher. It is just a question of whether he
cares to exercise his will and his ingenuity in the
interest of a healthy relation, or whether he chooses
rather to have his vanity flattered by attentions and
popularity.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CASE 156 (HIGH SCHOOL)</h4>

<div  class='c004'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Appeals to Vanity</div>

<p class='c007'>Annabel Kingsley was an English teacher in a small,
prosperous town. She was a tiny, sharp-faced girl of
about twenty-five, keenly intelligent, clever and selfseeking.
She dressed well; she sought social opportunities;
she made the most of her friends. Before
she had been teaching a month she had won the
devoted admiration of all the boys and most of the
girls in her classes and by Thanksgiving the other
women teachers would hardly speak to her, regarding
her with that silent scorn which intelligent women
<span class='pageno' id='Page_849'>849</span>have for their sisters who will not play fair. The
superintendent was divided between amusement and
contempt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Sperry, the mathematics teacher, went to Miss
Bulwer, who had had the Latin and German for years,
and had a talk with her. “My boys and girls come
day after day with their algebra only half learned,”
she complained. “They say they don’t have time for
it, and they are losing all their interest, too. But
they write great long compositions for Miss Kingsley
that must take hours to do, and now she talks of getting
up a play to be given at Christmas. She seems
to have captured them completely. How does she
do it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When you’ve seen as much of teachers as I have
you’ll know,” Miss Bulwer replied, grimly. “I haven’t
heard her talk to them, but I can tell you just how she
goes about it. She makes every one of them think he’s
the budding genius of the century. She has Verne
Gibbs reading Ibsen and planning to write a tragedy.
I’ll be bound! She has persuaded Morris Talbot that
he can write short stories. Warren Hughes thinks
he’s very remarkable because she told him he could
appreciate Francis Thompson. Maybe he can, but he
can also appreciate Cicero when he’s given half a
chance. Every one of those youngsters thinks that
at last he has found a teacher who really sees what is
in him, the great promise to which the rest of us are
blind. Then he proceeds to fall in love with Miss
Kingsley to show her that her interest is not lost. She
appeals to the adolescent vanity that they all have so
much of, and she’s making them so insufferably self-conscious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_850'>850</span>and sentimental and onesided that you and
I can’t do anything with them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Miss Sperry watched Miss Kingsley. She saw that
the boys who could use their father’s automobiles vied
with each other for the honor of taking her home on
Friday nights—she lived in a neighboring town; that
they hung over her desk before and after sessions, engaged
in interminable discussions of the value of
poetry or the madness of Hamlet. On her birthday
her desk was banked with roses; Miss Sperry wondered
how they found out when her birthday came.
Miss Kingsley’s work went very well, but she robbed
every other teacher of the time and energy that fairly
belonged to the other subjects taught. The result was
that the poor work caused by her selfish policy showed
in the classes of other teachers. In her own there was
a constant and lively interest, fanned continuously by
the numberless “conferences” with which she kept her
hold on her students. The school was badly demoralized
by Christmas, and yet the real cause of all the
trouble appeared to be the one brilliantly successful
teacher on the force.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>CONSTRUCTIVE TREATMENT</h4>

<p class='c016'>The principal of a school should see to it that each
teacher and each subject has a fair share of the attention
of the students. In this case, the principal should
say to Miss Kingsley, “I notice that a number of our
boys are falling behind with their mathematics, and
Miss Bulwer tells me that Howard Grimes failed in
Latin last month—something never heard of before.
I have been looking for the cause, and I find that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_851'>851</span>most of those who are failing are spending more time
on their English than is fair. You are stimulating
them by a personal appeal to put time on English
which really belongs to other studies. So I am asking
you to discontinue your private conferences for the
present; and, moreover, it is not dignified for you to
accept attentions from the boys as though they were
your own age; it will lead to criticism which will
hurt your work and your influence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Private talks to the boys and girls about their work,
following this restriction of the English teacher’s demands,
may help to bring results. The other teachers
should be encouraged to make their work as appealing
as possible, and to show a personal interest in the
bringing up of grades in the neglected studies. Most
important of all, wholesome social conditions may be
stimulated by a series of parties among the high school
students, in which normal relations amongst themselves
are encouraged. Such regulations for study
as are needed to keep the boys from too much contact
with Miss Kingsley are to be adopted, without making
their object obvious to the pupils.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>COMMENTS</h4>

<p class='c016'>The amative impulses of youth are not vicious, but
need direction and control. Self-control, above all
else, is to be taught, and the teaching must often be
reinforced by wise, friendly restraint. Frank friendships
are to be encouraged; sickly, silly sentimentality
laughed out of court. If a teacher, instead of standing
ready to give this help and guidance when it is
needed, encourages a sentimental devotion, as Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_852'>852</span>Kingsley did, the most fundamental safeguard of
youth is sacrificed—the ideal of controlled emotion,
of a conscious saving of a sacred experience for the
future. A large range of interests, a healthy balance
of activities, and a wholesome unconsciousness of self,
tend to keep young people simple and child-like in
their emotional lives. Above all, no teacher has any
business to give the impression that he alone appreciates
youth and its promise, or to make his relations
with impressionable boys and girls unduly personal.</p>

teacher in a small village high school. In his second
year of service, Carolyn Brush, daughter of the great
man of the town, decided that she would not return
to the fashionable boarding school which she had been
attending, but would go to the village school and subjugate
Clarence Miller, whom she met during the
Christmas vacation. She was very pretty and very
clever, and her stay in a girl’s boarding school had
not made her less romantic than other girls are.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lessons were easy for her, and during the first
few days she recited brilliantly, hoping to win special
attention from the young principal. He accepted her
most studied efforts with the same pleasant courtesy
he gave to all, and then Carolyn tried another plan.
She failed to recite altogether, looking at Mr. Miller
with a pitiful, hurt look whenever he called upon her,
and shaking her pretty head sadly. The village boys
and girls, somewhat awed at best by Carolyn’s pretty
clothes and polished manners, and keenly conscious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_853'>853</span>of everything she did, observed all this with much
interest. Carolyn became more and more enamored of
Mr. Miller the more she saw of him.</p>

<p class='c007'>One morning she stepped to the desk when there
were no other pupils near. “Mr. Miller,” she said,
“I wonder if I may speak to you—alone—some time?
Tonight, after school, perhaps? Just for a moment.
I am in such trouble.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course you may, Miss Carolyn,” said Mr.
Miller, heartily. “I’ll be glad to help you if I can.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Carolyn was not at school that afternoon. She
called up the school by telephone at five after four,
however, said that her mother had required her help
that afternoon, and added that they all wanted Mr.
Miller to come up for supper. “And I hope you will,
for I do feel that you can help me. We can talk after
supper.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sorry, but I have some work that is going to take
my whole evening, Miss Carolyn. You can tell me
about that matter at recess tomorrow. Please thank
your mother for the invitation, and tell her how sorry
I am I can’t come.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At recess the next morning, Carolyn said, when she
was sure no prying boy lingered near:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Mr. Miller, I have been so worried lately I
just couldn’t study. I have a dear friend at school,
whom I’ve trusted and loved for two years more than
anyone else. And now I find that she has deceived me,
and it almost breaks my heart. It seems as if everything
has just stopped, you know; life isn’t the same.
What can one do? If one can’t trust one’s friends,
what is there one can count upon?” She looked up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_854'>854</span>at him with tears in her eyes, the lovely picture of
disillusioned youth in its most appealing form. “I
just had to talk to some one about it, and you’re the
only person here who is—you know—like myself—who
would understand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Miller neither fell into this fair trap nor shied
at it. He said, “Now, I’ll tell you just what I would
do if I were you. You talk to your father. He knows
all about people, and he’ll give you more good advice
in a minute than I could in a year. If it were I, and a
girl had treated me like that, I’d find a better chum
and let her go, and not weep over it either. Just stop
worrying about her. You can’t afford to lose out on
your lessons for a snip of a girl who doesn’t know a
good friend when she has one. Oh—you’ll excuse me,
won’t you? I promised the boys to show them a new
curve, and here they are for me.” And the cautious,
sensible principal vanished out-of-doors.</p>

<p class='c007'>Carolyn, being really infatuated, made one more
attempt. “I know you don’t like me,” she told the
principal one day. “But why is it? What have I
done, that you should hate me so? I have tried to get
my lessons, and tried to be good in school; but you
seem to hate the very sight of me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, that’s all nonsense,” Mr. Miller averred. “I
like you just as well as anyone else in the room, and,
so far as I know and intend, I treat you just as I do
the others.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To be treated just as the others were treated, was
exactly what Carolyn did not want. She suddenly discovered
that the principal was not handsome, and that
she did not care for him. She told her father that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_855'>855</span>the school was so much poorer than Grey Gables that
she wanted to go back there, and at the Easter vacation
she left the high school. So Carolyn came and
went, and not one of the other pupils knew of the
little comedy of sentiment and sense that had taken
place there that winter.</p>

<p class='c007'>The quickly-veering emotion of youth is easily stimulated
or inhibited by suggestion. Mr. Miller saw
through the schemes of his pupil, and, instead of falling
in with them, as he might have done had he wanted
excitement or adulation or romantic adventure, he
cut them off in a friendly, but matter-of-fact way
that nipped expectation in the bud. A flirtation with
his pretty pupil might have been a great deal of fun,
but it would have marred his influence with the people
of the village and with his pupils; and he was wise
enough to deny himself that fun for the sake of his
professional duty. He might have stimulated an adventure
in half a dozen ways; he steadily declined
even to suggest the thought of such a thing until
Carolyn was cured of her fancy. Without humiliating
her in any way, before the other students, he kept his
relations with her impersonal and free of romantic
elements, and so gradually overcame her infatuation
by giving it nothing to feed upon.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>AN ILLUSTRATIVE CONTRAST BETWEEN FAILURE AND SUCCESS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Bradley was principal for two years of the
Newcastle school. He revealed his characteristics as
a teacher so fully that we find in him an example of
the type not to be recommended and yet one that is
very instructive for students of school discipline.</p>

<p class='c007'>In stature he was slightly below medium height.
He came from rural ancestry and was fairly well
equipped as to physique. He had black hair and eyes,
somewhat mobile features and a wandering gaze. His
movements could hardly be called quick, but they
were prompt and without distinct mannerisms.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had a most gracious manner when meeting
people on the street or in their homes. He spoke
kindly to everyone and had the reputation among the
townspeople of being a royal, good fellow. Even his
pupils could not deny that he treated them very courteously
and jovially outside of school hours.</p>

<p class='c007'>Despite all this he used essentially the method of the
hen-pecking incompetent when handling disciplinary
matters in school. The moment he entered the school
precincts he was a different man. His countenance
then betrayed the sternness of the schoolmaster who
dwelt within and apart from the polite gentleman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_860'>860</span>he seemed to be when outside the school-room. His
eyebrows gathered and his muscles reverberated with
the sense of authority that flooded his whole nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>His eye was on the lookout for misdemeanors and
if a pupil made a misstep in the realm where Mr.
Bradley thought he had jurisdiction, that harsh, strident
voice, with but the slightest trace of fellow-feeling,
spoke the word of correction or announced an
impending penalty.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the school-room it was his delight to slip up
behind an offender and pluck him by the ear as a
reminder of duty. Being the only instructor who
indulged in this practice it soon came to be one of the
most odious signals of his presence in the room. When
absorbed in his subject he made instruction interesting;
his pupils could not fail to learn if they did not
venture to vary the program by misconduct. However,
their recollection of his general attitude toward
them, the ease with which they could upset his plans
by introducing a few school pranks, the certainty that
he would lose his temper on slight provocation, always
hung as a barrage screen between them and undivided
concentration on the subject-matter of their lessons.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Bradley made it a practice to watch for accumulating
offenses. He felt incompetent to handle minor
evils, but attempted to squelch a wayward pupil by
reciting a list of grievances and applying penalties
for the same. He had a good memory for facts of this
sort. He could shake his finger in the face of a boy
or girl and say, “Didn’t you pull Esther’s hair yesterday&#160;... trip up Jimmie on the way to class in geometry
and purposely spill the crayons when you were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_861'>861</span>at the board? Now, I have had enough of this. I
want to know what you are going to do about it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This gentleman could not catch the drift of things.
Early in his first year Mr. Bradley’s attention rested
upon Ted. Ted was a short, heavy-set chap of some
fourteen years, incapable of any revolutionary propensities,
but able to interest himself with a variety
of aggravating tricks. His pranks were individually
almost too small to command severe penalties, but
they were too annoying to escape the principal’s eye.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unfortunately, Mr. Bradley hit upon the lash as a
cure for Ted. Selecting a more pronounced misdemeanor
as an opportunity for settling accounts with
the troublesome pupil, he gave him a sound whipping.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was some ground for the general protest that
arose from the high school. Ted was a favorite with
every one. The crude principal had struck one but he
had wounded all. His untactfulness had made him
abhorrent to all, even to those who had not hitherto
drawn upon themselves his specific disapproval and
useless punishments. Mr. Bradley, perhaps, never
knew that he had undermined his own usefulness as
much by this treatment of a school favorite as by any
single deed that transpired during his whole stay in
Newcastle.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had his own method of handling the problem
of whispering. He made it a rule that every pupil in
high school must answer at roll call at the end of the
day on the matter of whispering. If a pupil had
whispered he must answer “Present,” and specify
the number of times during the day he had whispered.
If he had a clear record on whispering he was privileged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_862'>862</span>to answer “Perfect.” Now, in fact, the pupils
formed cliques and agreements to such an extent that
they made almost a complete farce of this attempt at
discipline. They lied with the greatest liberty and
seemed to feel no restraint from their principal. He
appeared not to know that they were guilty of deception
and insubordination, and of course he became the
butt of ridicule because of these and many other
unwise acts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The girls would be found by him crying over the
low grades they received. Through their hands they
joyously watched him as he marched back to his desk
and silently changed the numerals. Occasionally he
returned and reported, “After thinking over your
work further I have decided to give you a better
grade.” He was more than paid for his trouble as
the smiles drove back the tears and the eyes of the
poor, grieved ones hung for a moment on his.</p>

<p class='c007'>He suffered from note-writing. Jim was a source
of anxiety on this score. The unvarying procedure
was the following:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is the paper you had a moment ago?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s in my desk.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is there any writing on it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I think so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hand it to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Silence on Jim’s part.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Jim, aren’t you going to give me that note?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Jim, you go at once to Mr. Evans’ room,” or,
“Take your books and go home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Not once, nor twice, but scores and scores of times
<span class='pageno' id='Page_863'>863</span>this same routine was followed. Jim never handed
him a note in the whole two years. Mr. Bradley never
discovered the intense satisfaction that Jim had in
drawing attention to himself, in defeating the principal
and in thus creating a general sensation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Bradley’s temper was easily aroused. At first
his face would turn white; the pupils quickly noted
his pallor and laughed at him; his anger then drove
him to a few tears, which one by one trickled down
his careworn cheeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>In these moments of ill-temper he was more helpless
than ever. He did not attempt to do much teaching
for a short period, but marked time until he could
recollect himself and get his pedagogical machine back
on track again.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the frequent, extreme cases of refractory pupils
that he had to dispose of, his main resort was to send
or accompany pupils to Mr. Evans, the superintendent
of schools. In reporting the misdemeanor or in remarking
on the items of a report of misconduct by the
pupil himself he adopted the very poor method of
exaggerating the circumstances insufferably. Often
he interrupted a pupil’s account with single words or
phrases that exaggerated the offense and so attempted
to justify himself in referring the case to higher authority.
These unfair methods enraged even a guilty
pupil to an extent that all hope of his returning to
the high school room with any little good will toward
the principal was lost.</p>

<p class='c007'>You at once inquire, How was it possible for a man
of this sort to keep his position for two years? The
answer is two-fold: his treatment of pupils and citizens
<span class='pageno' id='Page_864'>864</span>generally outside of school hours was such as, in
a way, to discredit the impressions reported by dissatisfied
pupils; the superintendent was capable
enough himself to neutralize, in part, the ill effects of
the principal’s poor disciplinary methods and thus to
enable him to retain a well informed instructor.</p>

<p class='c007'>You want to know more about this remarkable superintendent,
Mr. Evans? His personal presence was
somewhat in his favor. He was a man of good height,
but very slender. The look of his eye was direct and
lingering. His hand-grasp was warm, kindly and
reassuring. He was never in a hurry, but disposed of
mountains of work. He always took time to hear all
that pupils had to say—one of his strongest assets.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a valuable lesson in school discipline just to
observe him in an interview with an offending pupil.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Jim, what is it this morning?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I suppose I’ve got to tell you about a little affair
that occurred in the Latin class yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come and have this chair over here by the desk.
Excuse me until I pull down the shade a bit. Well,
now, go on. What is it all about?”</p>

<p class='c007'>But these cold words do not convey to the reader
the impression that they made on Jim. There was a
yearning in the voice that fairly drew Jim out of himself.
He had just come from a fresh combat with Mr.
Bradley and was in a mood to do battle; in fact, strange
to say, this thought crossed his mind, “All right, I’ll
go in to see Evans. If he has it in for me, I’ll show
them both a new deal; I’ll give them the time of their
lives in this town!”</p>

<p class='c007'>How easy it would have been to set fire to this piece
<span class='pageno' id='Page_865'>865</span>of tow and so produce an uncontrollable conflagration.
But there was Mr. Evans’ voice, so suave and appealing.
He assumed that Jim had something interesting
to tell; that he had suffered some accident; that he
was in search of a friend. Mr. Evans was that friend.
He said, “You know, of course, that I’ll want to hear
the other side of the story, but you go ahead and tell
me everything just exactly as it is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Jim told his story. The superintendent nodded
assent to the several statements, indicating that he had
taken in their full significance and was laying the
ground for a just disposition of the matter. About
the time Jim finished, Mr. Bradley stepped in. He
soon began his account of the affair. Mr. Evans
listened with a judicial air, by no means disclosing
any antagonism toward his principal, but very cautious
not to give Jim any notion that the principal
had the inside track in the mind and sympathy of his
superior. There were no comments, no nodding of
the head, no knowing smiles that meant, “We’ll fix
this fellow, all right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Since Mr. Evans had previously frankly said that
he would hear the principal’s story, in the first part of
the interview, Jim was not surprised that it was given
unremitting attention. But he was highly pleased to
see that favoritism for the principal was not going to
play any part in the final settlement of the matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>In fact, every pupil expected to see Mr. Evans go
the second mile in any case where he came intimately
into contact with a pupil, either in the ordinary affairs
of the school, or when disciplinary problems must be
adjudicated. It was, in a way, a painful experience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_866'>866</span>to meet Mr. Evans under circumstances such as these;
he made one feel grieved to impose on him by wrenching
his heart with disappointment. There was no fear
of consequences, but an anguish over injuring the
feelings of the superintendent.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the facts were all before him, this friend of
boys and girls would say:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t believe it would be right in this case to&#160;...” and he would mention penalties that were
severe, though perhaps often employed by other
teachers, perhaps were even not condemned by the
community. He would finally come to the conclusion
of the matter by saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think we can fix this up in this way&#160;...” a
method that was almost without exception such as to
strengthen the discipline of the school, to rescue the
pupil from provoking circumstances and probably to
serve as a deterrent to future misconduct.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the conclusion of every case of discipline, Mr.
Evans left the situation in a better status than before.
The boy or girl who had to settle accounts with the
superintendent, when all was said and done, knew
that the issue was disposed of according to the principles
of right and for the good of both the pupil and
the school. Wisdom, sympathetic understanding,
willingness to make concessions, positive devotion to
the pupil’s comfort and welfare, were written all over
the man’s actions so plainly as to disarm criticism
and to bind every pupil to him as a life-long friend.</p>

<p class='c007'>Throughout this Course for teachers, we have
steadily laid emphasis on the need in the pupil for the
cultivation of self-control as a basis for any satisfactory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_867'>867</span>building of character. Scarcely less have we
insisted that the same trait of character is essential in
a successful teacher. Our survey of the blunders of
disciplinarians leads to the conclusion that by far the
larger part committed by school teachers can be traced
back to an inexcusable lack of this central virtue of
self-control.</p>

<p class='c007'>The passionate, selfish teacher can not see the pupil’s
point of view. The measureless transformations of
the adolescent period throw a vast majority of people
out of sympathy with the adolescent and still more
with those of younger years.</p>

<p class='c007'>The system of school discipline advocated in this
Course for teachers, frankly rests on coöperation with
the pupil, initiative being taken by the teacher in
working out disciplinary problems in frank, wholehearted
adjustment to pupil needs and characteristics.
No teacher can adopt the policy represented by this
principle without attaining, in a measure, and further
developing his own self-control. Our experience and
observation, our fresh survey of all the facts while
compiling the data presented in these volumes, have
deepened immeasurably the conviction that the teacher
who seeks the level of the life of the children whom
he wishes to govern, assisting them, aiding them, guiding
them according to the dictates of their natures
rather than contrariwise, will cure himself of one of
his own worst vices, namely, anarchy in mood, temper
and judgment; and will develop in its place the basic
element of a noble character, self-control.</p>

<p class='c007'>By presenting, as a final word, the contrast between
these two teachers, we hope to heighten the impressions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_868'>868</span>that have repeatedly been made as the reader
has followed the narratives and discussions contained
in the preceding pages. Remember that the two men
here described worked under the same circumstances,
during the same two years, with the same pupils, in
the same building; that each had the benefit of consultation
with the other, that both were well received
in public and had many friends among the business
men and in the homes of the city. The advantage in
physical organization lay with him who failed. The
essential difference between the two is found in the
inner, basic attitude of each toward his pupils.</p>

<p class='c007'>The one ruled by personality and broad, humane
principles; the other was an apostle of force, fitfully
administered, as, in fact, it must of necessity be administered.
The one was conscious of his authority;
the other forgot it and worked man to man with
his pupils. The one exhausted his force and failed;
the other scarcely ever drew upon his reserve and
never lost a pupil friend. The one ground his teeth
in rage at the perversity and rebellion of his pupils,
the other enjoyed their friendship and reveled in
the memories of sympathetic appreciation of his
labors. In short, one was beloved by all, the other
despised.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of all the words from tongue or pen that explain
the more desirable of the two methods described, none
is better than the word Coöperation. This is the
capstone of our five fundamental principles—Suggestion,
Substitution, Expectation, Approval, Coöperation.
Approval of good effort, in fact, turns out to
be one mode of coöperation with the pupil. It ministers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_869'>869</span>to his self-love and elicits further effort. A
teacher can not exemplify this one principle of coöperation
without hitting upon or consciously employing
all the others we have named and illustrated. “I work
with my pupils,” is the highest self-praise a teacher
can utter. It is a simple, modest, unassuming statement;
if true in its deepest sense, he who thus speaks
of himself is a perfect teacher and disciplinarian.</p>

<p class='c007'>We commend this gospel to coöperative school-room
discipline to every aspiring teacher who reads these
volumes; we can only hope that every one may be
converted heart and soul to this mode of action and
with religious devotion set about remoulding his treatment
and management of school children so that he
truly may be a Friend to Man.</p>
